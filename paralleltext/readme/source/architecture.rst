This page will briefly describe the architecture behind the Parallel-Text Project. In addition for paragraph on Hosting I will briefly describe why we chose that particular company over the competitors. 

.. _deployment
Deployment
=========

Parallel-Text is hosted entirely on Heroku. Heroku used to be Ruby on Rails platform exclusively. Recently, they have added support for Python/Django, node.js, Java and many other languages and frameworks.

We chose Heroku because of how simple it is to deploy the application. Parallel-Text was up and running on the cloud in a matter of minutes. Although, initially there were some issures regarding the deployment; but we were able to fix it successfully.

.. _django-packages
Django and Packages
======================

Prallel-Text is built on top of Django 1.5.1. 

In addition to the django packages provided by the Pinax we have used the following libraries and python packages:

	* Django==1.5.1
	* argparse==1.2.1
	* beautifulsoup4==4.1.3
	* distribute==0.6.34
	* dj-database-url==0.2.1
	* gunicorn==0.17.2
	* logilab-astng==0.24.3
	* logilab-common==0.59.1
	* psycopg2==2.5
	* wsgiref==0.1.2

.. _database-configuration
Database Configuration
==================

In development we use SQLite database. It's extremely easy to setup and use. SQLite provides a fairly simple database storage as a file. 

In production we use PostgreSQL mainly because Heroku enforces it. It replaces your existing Django database settings with the PostgreSQL settings provided by Heroku upon deployment of the project.
