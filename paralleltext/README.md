# ParallelText

This site is a tool for language educators. It lays out texts in parallel with each other. One of the texts will be a translation into the user's native language. The other text will be the foreign language original.

The project Wiki consisting of documentations and related supporting information can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/RoadrunnerAtWaste/paralleltext/wiki/Home) and the is [ParallelText](http://parallel-text.herokuapp.com/) site.
