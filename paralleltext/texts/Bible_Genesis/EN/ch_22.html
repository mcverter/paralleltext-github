<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">22,1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him: 'Abraham'; and he said: 'Here am I.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">22,2 And He said: 'Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.'</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">22,3 And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">22,4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">22,5 And Abraham said unto his young men: 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come back to you.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">22,6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">22,7 And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said: 'My father.' And he said: 'Here am I, my son.' And he said: 'Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">22,8 And Abraham said: 'God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son.' So they went both of them together. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">22,9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">22,10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">22,11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said: 'Abraham, Abraham.' And he said: 'Here am I.'</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">22,12 And he said: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">22,13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">22,14 And Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-jireh; as it is said to this day: 'In the mount where the LORD is seen.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">22,15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">22,16 and said: 'By Myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">22,17 that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">22,18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast hearkened to My voice.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">22,19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">22,20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying: 'Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">22,21 Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">22,22 and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22,23 And Bethuel begot Rebekah; these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">22,24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah. </p>
