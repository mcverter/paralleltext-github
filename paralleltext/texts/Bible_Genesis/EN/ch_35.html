<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">35,1 And God said unto Jacob: 'Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esau thy brother.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">35,2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him: 'Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments;</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">35,3 and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">35,4 And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth which was by Shechem. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">35,5 And they journeyed; and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">35,6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan--the same is Beth-el--he and all the people that were with him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">35,7 And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el, because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">35,8 And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">35,9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">35,10 And God said unto him: 'Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name'; and He called his name Israel. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">35,11 And God said unto him: 'I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">35,12 and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">35,13 And God went up from him in the place where He spoke with him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">35,14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He spoke with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">35,15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">35,16 And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">35,17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the mid-wife said unto her: 'Fear not; for this also is a son for thee.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">35,18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing--for she died--that she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">35,19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath--the same is Beth-lehem. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">35,20 And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; the same is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">35,21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond Migdal-eder. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">35,22 And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it.  Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">35,23 the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">35,24 the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">35,25 and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">35,26 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">35,27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriatharba--the same is Hebron--where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">35,28 And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">35,29 And Isaac expired, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. </p>
