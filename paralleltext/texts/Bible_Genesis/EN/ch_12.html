<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">12,1 Now the LORD said unto Abram: 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">12,2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">12,3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">12,4 So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">12,5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">12,6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the terebinth of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">12,7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said: 'Unto thy seed will I give this land'; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">12,8 And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">12,9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">12,10 And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">12,11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife: 'Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">12,12 And it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say: This is his wife; and they will kill me, but thee they will keep alive. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12,13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">12,14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">12,15 And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">12,16 And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">12,17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">12,18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said: 'What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">12,19 Why saidst thou: She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife; now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">12,20 And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him; and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>
