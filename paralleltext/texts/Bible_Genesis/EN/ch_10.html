<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">10,3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">10,4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">10,5 Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">10,6 And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">10,8 And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">10,9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; wherefore it is said: 'Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">10,10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10,11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">10,12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah--the same is the great city. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">10,13 And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">10,14 and Pathrusim, and Casluhim--whence went forth the Philistines--and Caphtorim.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">10,15 And Canaan begot Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">10,16 and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">10,17 and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite;</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">10,18 and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">10,19 And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">10,20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">10,21 And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">10,22 The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">10,23 And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">10,24 And Arpachshad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">10,25 And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">10,26 And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">10,27 and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">10,28 and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">10,29 and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">10,30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, unto the mountain of the east. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">10,31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">10,32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. </p>
