<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">15,1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying: 'Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceeding great.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">15,2 And Abram said: 'O Lord GOD, what wilt Thou give me, seeing I go hence childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">15,3 And Abram said: 'Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed, and, lo, one born in my house is to be mine heir.'</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">15,4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying: 'This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">15,5 And He brought him forth abroad, and said: 'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them'; and He said unto him: 'So shall thy seed be.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">15,6 And he believed in the LORD; and He counted it to him for righteousness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">15,7 And He said unto him: 'I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">15,8 And he said: 'O Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">15,9 And He said unto him: 'Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">15,10 And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds divided he not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">15,11 And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">15,12 And it came to pass, that, when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a dread, even a great darkness, fell upon him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">15,13 And He said unto Abram: 'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">15,14 and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">15,15 But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15,16 And in the fourth generation they shall come back hither; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">15,17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and there was thick darkness, behold a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">15,18 In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">15,19 the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">15,20 and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">15,21 and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.' </p>
