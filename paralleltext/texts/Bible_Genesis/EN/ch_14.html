<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">14,1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">14,2 that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela--the same is Zoar. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">14,3 All these came as allies unto the vale of Siddim--the same is the Salt Sea. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">14,4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">14,5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">14,6 and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">14,7 And they turned back, and came to En-mishpat--the same is Kadesh--and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">14,8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela--the same is Zoar; and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">14,9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">14,10 Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">14,11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">14,12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">14,13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew--now he dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">14,14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14,15 And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">14,16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">14,17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh--the same is the King's Vale. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">14,18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was priest of God the Most High.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">14,19 And he blessed him, and said: 'Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">14,20 and blessed be God the Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.' And he gave him a tenth of all. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">14,21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram: 'Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">14,22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom: 'I have lifted up my hand unto the LORD, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">14,23 that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say: I have made Abram rich; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">14,24 save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.' </p>
