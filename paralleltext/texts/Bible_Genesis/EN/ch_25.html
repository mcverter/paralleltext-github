<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">25,1 And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">25,2 And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">25,3 And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">25,4 And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">25,5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">25,6 But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">25,7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">25,8 And Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">25,9 And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">25,10 the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth; there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">25,11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">25,12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore unto Abraham. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">25,13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">25,14 and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">25,15 Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedem; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">25,16 these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">25,17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expired and died; and was gathered unto his people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">25,18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Asshur: over against all his brethren he did settle. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">25,19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">25,20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">25,21 And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD let Himself be entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">25,22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said: 'If it be so, wherefore do I live?' And she went to inquire of the LORD. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">25,23 And the LORD said unto her: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">25,24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">25,25 And the first came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy mantle; and they called his name Esau. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25,26 And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">25,27 And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">25,28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">25,29 And Jacob sod pottage; and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">25,30 And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.' Therefore was his name called Edom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">25,31 And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy birthright.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">25,32 And Esau said: 'Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall the birthright do to me?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">25,33 And Jacob said: 'Swear to me first'; and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">25,34 And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright. </p>
