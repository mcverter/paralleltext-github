<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">21,1 And the LORD remembered Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as He had spoken. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">21,2 And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">21,3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">21,4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">21,5 And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">21,6 And Sarah said: 'God hath made laughter for me; every one that heareth will laugh on account of me.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">21,7 And she said: 'Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">21,8 And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">21,9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, making sport.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">21,10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham: 'Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">21,11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">21,12 And God said unto Abraham: 'Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall seed be called to thee. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">21,13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">21,14 And Abraham arose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and strayed in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">21,15 And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">21,16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow-shot; for she said: 'Let me not look upon the death of the child.' And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">21,17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her: 'What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">21,18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast by thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">21,19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">21,20 And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">21,21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21,22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying: 'God is with thee in all that thou doest. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">21,23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">21,24 And Abraham said: 'I will swear.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">21,25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">21,26 And Abimelech said: 'I know not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">21,27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">21,28 And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">21,29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham: 'What mean these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set by themselves?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">21,30 And he said: 'Verily, these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">21,31 Wherefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there they swore both of them.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">21,32 So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">21,33 And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">21,34 And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days. </p>
