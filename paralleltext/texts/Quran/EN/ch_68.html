<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 68. Qalam, or the Pen, or Nun </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Nun. By the Pen and the [Record] which [men] write,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Thou art not, by the Grace of thy Lord, mad or possessed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Nay, verily for thee is a Reward unfailing: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And thou [standest] on an exalted standard of character. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Soon wilt thou see, and they will see, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Which of you is afflicted with madness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Verily it is thy Lord that knoweth best, which [among men] hath strayed fromHis Path: and He knoweth best those who receive [true] Guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  So hearken not to those who deny [the Truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Their desire is that thou shouldst be pliant: so would they be pliant. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Heed not the type of despicable men,- ready with oaths, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  A slanderer, going about with calumnies, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  [Habitually] hindering [all] good, transgressing beyond bounds, deep in sin, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Violent [and cruel],- with all that, base-born,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Because he possesses wealth and [numerous] sons. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  When to him are rehearsed Our Signs, "Tales of the ancients", he cries! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Soon shall We brand [the beast] on the snout! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Verily We have tried them as We tried the People of the Garden, when theyresolved to gather the fruits of the [garden] in the morning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  But made no reservation, ["If it be Allah's Will"]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Then there came on the [garden] a visitation from thy Lord, [which sweptaway] all around, while they were asleep. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  So the [garden] became, by the morning, like a dark and desolate spot,[whose fruit had been gathered]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  As the morning broke, they called out, one to another,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  "Go ye to your tilth [betimes] in the morning, if ye would gather thefruits." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  So they departed, conversing in secret low tones, [saying]-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  "Let not a single indigent person break in upon you into the [garden] thisday." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  And they opened the morning, strong in an [unjust] resolve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  But when they saw the [garden], they said: "We have surely lost our way: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "Indeed we are shut out [of the fruits of our labour]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Said one of them, more just [than the rest]: "Did I not say to you, 'Why notglorify [Allah]?'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  They said: "Glory to our Lord! Verily we have been doing wrong!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Then they turned, one against another, in reproach. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  They said: "Alas for us! We have indeed transgressed! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  "It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better [garden] thanthis: for we do turn to Him [in repentance]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Such is the Punishment [in this life]; but greater is the Punishment in theHereafter,- if only they knew! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Verily, for the Righteous, are Gardens of Delight, in the Presence of theirLord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Shall We then treat the People of Faith like the People of Sin? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  What is the matter with you? How judge ye? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Or have ye a book through which ye learn-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  That ye shall have, through it whatever ye choose? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  Or have ye Covenants with Us to oath, reaching to the Day of Judgment,[providing] that ye shall have whatever ye shall demand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Ask thou of them, which of them will stand surety for that! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Or have they some "Partners" [in Allahhead]? Then let them produce their"partners", if they are truthful! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  The Day that the shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to bowin adoration, but they shall not be able,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  Their eyes will be cast down,- ignominy will cover them; seeing that theyhad been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration, while they were whole, [and hadrefused]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Then leave Me alone with such as reject this Message: by degrees shall Wepunish them from directions they perceive not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  A [long] respite will I grant them: truly powerful is My Plan. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Or is it that thou dost ask them for a reward, so that they are burdenedwith a load of debt?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Or that the Unseen is in their hands, so that they can write it down? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  So wait with patience for the Command of thy Lord, and be not like theCompanion of the Fish,- when he cried out in agony. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Had not Grace from his Lord reached him, he would indeed have been cast offon the naked shore, in disgrace. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  Thus did his Lord choose him and make him of the Company of the Righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  And the Unbelievers would almost trip thee up with their eyes when they hearthe Message; and they say: "Surely he is possessed!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  But it is nothing less than a Message to all the worlds. </p>
