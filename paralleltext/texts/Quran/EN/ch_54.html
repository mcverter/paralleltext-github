<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 54. Qamar, or the Moon </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  The Hour [of Judgment] is nigh, and the moon is cleft asunder. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, "This is [but] transientmagic." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  They reject [the warning] and follow their [own] lusts but every matter hasits appointed time. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  There have already come to them Recitals wherein there is [enough] to check[them], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Mature wisdom;- but [the preaching of] Warners profits them not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Therefore, [O Prophet,] turn away from them. The Day that the Caller willcall [them] to a terrible affair, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  They will come forth,- their eyes humbled - from [their] graves, [torpid]like locusts scattered abroad, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Hastening, with eyes transfixed, towards the Caller!- "Hard is this Day!",the Unbelievers will say. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Before them the People of Noah rejected [their messenger]: they rejected Ourservant, and said, "Here is one possessed!", and he was driven out. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Then he called on his Lord: "I am one overcome: do Thou then help [me]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  So We opened the gates of heaven, with water pouring forth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met [androse] to the extent decreed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  But We bore him on an [Ark] made of broad planks and caulked with palm­fibre: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  She floats under our eyes [and care]: a recompense to one who had beenrejected [with scorn]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  And We have left this as a Sign [for all time]: then is there any that willreceive admonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  But how [terrible] was My Penalty and My Warning? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then isthere any that will receive admonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  The 'Ad [people] [too] rejected [Truth]: then how terrible was My Penaltyand My Warning? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  For We sent against them a furious wind, on a Day of violent Disaster, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Plucking out men as if they were roots of palm-trees torn up [from theground]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Yea, how [terrible] was My Penalty and My Warning! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  But We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then isthere any that will receive admonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  The Thamud [also] rejected [their] Warners. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  For they said: "What! a man! a Solitary one from among ourselves! shall wefollow such a one? Truly should we then be straying in mind, and mad! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  "Is it that the Message is sent to him, of all people amongst us? Nay, he isa liar, an insolent one!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Ah! they will know on the morrow, which is the liar, the insolent one! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  For We will send the she-camel by way of trial for them. So watch them, [OSalih], and possess thyself in patience! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  And tell them that the water is to be divided between them: Each one's rightto drink being brought forward [by suitable turns]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  But they called to their companion, and he took a sword in hand, andhamstrung [her]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Ah! how [terrible] was My Penalty and My Warning! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  For We sent against them a single Mighty Blast, and they became like the drystubble used by one who pens cattle. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then isthere any that will receive admonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  The people of Lut rejected [his] warning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  We sent against them a violent Tornado with showers of stones, [whichdestroyed them], except Lut's household: them We delivered by early Dawn,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  As a Grace from Us: thus do We reward those who give thanks. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  And [Lut] did warn them of Our Punishment, but they disputed about theWarning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  And they even sought to snatch away his guests from him, but We blindedtheir eyes. [They heard:] "Now taste ye My Wrath and My Warning." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Early on the morrow an abiding Punishment seized them: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  "So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then isthere any that will receive admonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  To the People of Pharaoh, too, aforetime, came Warners [from Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  The [people] rejected all Our Signs; but We seized them with such Penalty[as comes] from One Exalted in Power, able to carry out His Will. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  Are your Unbelievers, [O Quraish], better than they? Or have ye an immunityin the Sacred Books? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Or do they say: "We acting together can defend ourselves"? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Soon will their multitude be put to flight, and they will show their backs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Nay, the Hour [of Judgment] is the time promised them [for their fullrecompense]: And that Hour will be most grievous and most bitter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Truly those in sin are the ones straying in mind, and mad. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  The Day they will be dragged through the Fire on their faces, [they willhear:] "Taste ye the touch of Hell!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  And Our Command is but a single [Act],- like the twinkling of an eye. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  And [oft] in the past, have We destroyed gangs like unto you: then is thereany that will receive admonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  All that they do is noted in [their] Books [of Deeds]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  Every matter, small and great, is on record. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  As to the Righteous, they will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  In an Assembly of Truth, in the Presence of a Sovereign Omnipotent. </p>
