<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 80. Abasa, or He Frowned </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  [The Prophet] frowned and turned away, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Because there came to him the blind man [interrupting]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  But what could tell thee but that perchance he might grow [in spiritualunderstanding]?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Or that he might receive admonition, and the teaching might profit him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  As to one who regards Himself as self-sufficient, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  To him dost thou attend; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Though it is no blame to thee if he grow not [in spiritual understanding]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  But as to him who came to thee striving earnestly, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And with fear [in his heart], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Of him wast thou unmindful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  By no means [should it be so]! For it is indeed a Message of instruction: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Therefore let whoso will, keep it in remembrance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  [It is] in Books held [greatly] in honour, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Exalted [in dignity], kept pure and holy, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  [Written] by the hands of scribes-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Honourable and Pious and Just. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Woe to man! What hath made him reject Allah; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  From what stuff hath He created him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  From a sperm-drop: He hath created him, and then mouldeth him in dueproportions; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Then doth He make His path smooth for him; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Then He causeth him to die, and putteth him in his grave; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Then, when it is His Will, He will raise him up [again]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  By no means hath he fulfilled what Allah hath commanded him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Then let man look at his food, [and how We provide it]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  For that We pour forth water in abundance, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And We split the earth in fragments, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And produce therein corn, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  And Grapes and nutritious plants, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  And Olives and Dates, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  And enclosed Gardens, dense with lofty trees, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  And fruits and fodder,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  For use and convenience to you and your cattle. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  At length, when there comes the Deafening Noise,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  That Day shall a man flee from his own brother, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  And from his mother and his father, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  And from his wife and his children. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Each one of them, that Day, will have enough concern [of his own] to makehim indifferent to the others. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Some faces that Day will be beaming, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  Laughing, rejoicing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  And other faces that Day will be dust-stained, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Blackness will cover them: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Such will be the Rejecters of Allah, the doers of iniquity. </p>
