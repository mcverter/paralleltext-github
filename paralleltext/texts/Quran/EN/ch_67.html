<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 67. Mulk, or Dominion </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Blessed be He in Whose hands is Dominion; and He over all things hath Power;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  He Who created Death and Life, that He may try which of you is best in deed:and He is the Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  He Who created the seven heavens one above another: No want of proportionwilt thou see in the Creation of [Allah] Most Gracious. So turn thy visionagain: seest thou any flaw? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Again turn thy vision a second time: [thy] vision will come back to thee dulland discomfited, in a state worn out. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And we have, [from of old], adorned the lowest heaven with Lamps, and We havemade such [Lamps] [as] missiles to drive away the Evil Ones, and have preparedfor them the Penalty of the Blazing Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  For those who reject their Lord [and Cherisher] is the Penalty of Hell: andevil is [such], Destination. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  When they are cast therein, they will hear the [terrible] drawing in of itsbreath even as it blazes forth, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Almost bursting with fury: Every time a Group is cast therein, its Keeperswill ask, "Did no Warner come to you?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  They will say: "Yes indeed; a Warner did come to us, but we rejected him andsaid, 'Allah never sent down any [Message]: ye are nothing but an egregiousdelusion!'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  They will further say: "Had we but listened or used our intelligence, weshould not [now] be among the Companions of the Blazing Fire!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  They will then confess their sins: but far will be [Forgiveness] from theCompanions of the Blazing Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  As for those who fear their Lord unseen, for them is Forgiveness and a greatReward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And whether ye hide your word or publish it, He certainly has [full]knowledge, of the secrets of [all] hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Should He not know,- He that created? and He is the One that understands thefinest mysteries [and] is well-acquainted [with them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  It is He Who has made the earth manageable for you, so traverse ye throughits tracts and enjoy of the Sustenance which He furnishes: but unto Him is theResurrection. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Do ye feel secure that He Who is in heaven will not cause you to beswallowed up by the earth when it shakes [as in an earthquake]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Or do ye feel secure that He Who is in Heaven will not send against you aviolent tornado [with showers of stones], so that ye shall know how [terrible]was My warning? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  But indeed men before them rejected [My warning]: then how [terrible] was Myrejection [of them]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading their wings and foldingthem in? None can uphold them except [Allah] Most Gracious: Truly [Allah] MostGracious: Truly it is He that watches over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Nay, who is there that can help you, [even as] an army, besides [Allah] MostMerciful? In nothing but delusion are the Unbelievers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Or who is there that can provide you with Sustenance if He were to withholdHis provision? Nay, they obstinately persist in insolent impiety and flight[from the Truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Is then one who walks headlong, with his face grovelling, better guided,- orone who walks evenly on a Straight Way? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Say: "It is He Who has created you [and made you grow], and made for you thefaculties of hearing, seeing, feeling and understanding: little thanks it is yegive. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Say: "It is He Who has multiplied you through the earth, and to Him shall yebe gathered together." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  They ask: When will this promise be [fulfilled]? - If ye are telling thetruth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Say: "As to the knowledge of the time, it is with Allah alone: I am [sent]only to warn plainly in public." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  At length, when they see it close at hand, grieved will be the faces of theUnbelievers, and it will be said [to them]: "This is [the promise fulfilled],which ye were calling for!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Say: "See ye?- If Allah were to destroy me, and those with me, or if Hebestows His Mercy on us,- yet who can deliver the Unbelievers from a grievousPenalty?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Say: "He is [Allah] Most Gracious: We have believed in Him, and on Him havewe put our trust: So, soon will ye know which [of us] it is that is in manifesterror." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Say: "See ye?- If your stream be some morning lost [in the undergroundearth], who then can supply you with clear-flowing water?" </p>
