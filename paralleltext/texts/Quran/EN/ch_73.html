<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 73. Muzzammil, or Folded in Garments </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  O thou folded in garments! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Stand [to prayer] by night, but not all night,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Half of it,- or a little less, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Or a little more; and recite the Qur'an in slow, measured rhythmic tones. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Soon shall We send down to thee a weighty Message. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Truly the rising by night is most potent for governing [the soul], and mostsuitable for [framing] the Word [of Prayer and Praise]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  True, there is for thee by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  But keep in remembrance the name of thy Lord and devote thyself to Him whole­heartedly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  [He is] Lord of the East and the West: there is no god but He: take Himtherefore for [thy] Disposer of Affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And have patience with what they say, and leave them with noble [dignity]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  And leave Me [alone to deal with] those in possession of the good things oflife, who [yet] deny the Truth; and bear with them for a little while. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  With Us are Fetters [to bind them], and a Fire [to burn them], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And a Food that chokes, and a Penalty Grievous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  One Day the earth and the mountains will be in violent commotion. And themountains will be as a heap of sand poured out and flowing down. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  We have sent to you, [O men!] a messenger, to be a witness concerning you,even as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger; so We seized him with a heavyPunishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Then how shall ye, if ye deny [Allah], guard yourselves against a Day thatwill make children hoary-headed?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Whereon the sky will be cleft asunder? His Promise needs must beaccomplished. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Verily this is an Admonition: therefore, whoso will, let him take a[straight] path to his Lord! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Thy Lord doth know that thou standest forth [to prayer] nigh two-thirds ofthe night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and so doth a party ofthose with thee. But Allah doth appoint night and day in due measure He knoweththat ye are unable to keep count thereof. So He hath turned to you [in mercy]:read ye, therefore, of the Qur'an as much as may be easy for you. He knoweththat there may be [some] among you in ill-health; others travelling through theland, seeking of Allah's bounty; yet others fighting in Allah's Cause, read ye,therefore, as much of the Qur'an as may be easy [for you]; and establish regularPrayer and give regular Charity; and loan to Allah a Beautiful Loan. Andwhatever good ye send forth for your souls ye shall find it in Allah's </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">Presence,- yea, better and greater, in Reward and seek ye the Grace of Allah:for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.  </p>
