<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 57. Hadid, or Iron </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Whatever is in the heavens and on earth,- let it declare the Praises andGlory of Allah: for He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: It is He Who givesLife and Death; and He has Power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent: and He has fullknowledge of all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and is moreoverfirmly established on the Throne [of Authority]. He knows what enters within theearth and what comes forth out of it, what comes down from heaven and whatmounts up to it. And He is with you wheresoever ye may be. And Allah sees wellall that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: and all affairs arereferred back to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  He merges Night into Day, and He merges Day into Night; and He has fullknowledge of the secrets of [all] hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Believe in Allah and His messenger, and spend [in charity] out of the[substance] whereof He has made you heirs. For, those of you who believe andspend [in charity],- for them is a great Reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  What cause have ye why ye should not believe in Allah?- and the Messengerinvites you to believe in your Lord, and has indeed taken your Covenant, if yeare men of Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  He is the One Who sends to His Servant Manifest Signs, that He may lead youfrom the depths of Darkness into the Light and verily Allah is to you most kindand Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And what cause have ye why ye should not spend in the cause of Allah?- Forto Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. Not equal among youare those who spent [freely] and fought, before the Victory, [with those who didso later]. Those are higher in rank than those who spent [freely] and foughtafterwards. But to all has Allah promised a goodly [reward]. And Allah is wellacquainted with all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Who is he that will Loan to Allah a beautiful loan? for [Allah] willincrease it manifold to his credit, and he will have [besides] a liberal Reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  One Day shalt thou see the believing men and the believing women- how theirLight runs forward before them and by their right hands: [their greeting willbe]: "Good News for you this Day! Gardens beneath which flow rivers! to dwelltherein for aye! This is indeed the highest Achievement!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  One Day will the Hypocrites- men and women - say to the Believers: "Wait forus! Let us borrow [a Light] from your Light!" It will be said: "Turn ye back toyour rear! then seek a Light [where ye can]!" So a wall will be put up betwixtthem, with a gate therein. Within it will be Mercy throughout, and without it,all alongside, will be [Wrath and] Punishment! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  [Those without] will call out, "Were we not with you?" [The others] willreply, "True! but ye led yourselves into temptation; ye looked forward [to ourruin]; ye doubted [Allah's Promise]; and [your false] desires deceived you;until there issued the Command of Allah. And the Deceiver deceived you inrespect of Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  "This Day shall no ransom be accepted of you, nor of those who rejectedAllah." Your abode is the Fire: that is the proper place to claim you: and anevil refuge it is!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Has not the Time arrived for the Believers that their hearts in all humilityshould engage in the remembrance of Allah and of the Truth which has beenrevealed [to them], and that they should not become like those to whom was givenRevelation aforetime, but long ages passed over them and their hearts grew hard?For many among them are rebellious transgressors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Know ye [all] that Allah giveth life to the earth after its death! alreadyhave We shown the Signs plainly to you, that ye may learn wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  For those who give in Charity, men and women, and loan to Allah a BeautifulLoan, it shall be increased manifold [to their credit], and they shall have[besides] a liberal reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And those who believe in Allah and His messengers- they are the Sincere[lovers of Truth], and the witnesses [who testify], in the eyes of their Lord:They shall have their Reward and their Light. But those who reject Allah anddeny Our Signs,- they are the Companions of Hell-Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Know ye [all], that the life of this world is but play and amusement, pompand mutual boasting and multiplying, [in rivalry] among yourselves, riches andchildren. Here is a similitude: How rain and the growth which it brings forth,delight [the hearts of] the tillers; soon it withers; thou wilt see it growyellow; then it becomes dry and crumbles away. But in the Hereafter is a Penaltysevere [for the devotees of wrong]. And Forgiveness from Allah and [His] GoodPleasure [for the devotees of Allah]. And what is the life of this world, butgoods and chattels of deception? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Be ye foremost [in seeking] Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden [ofBliss], the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared forthose who believe in Allah and His messengers: that is the Grace of Allah, whichHe bestows on whom he pleases: and Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  No misfortune can happen on earth or in your souls but is recorded in adecree before We bring it into existence: That is truly easy for Allah: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  In order that ye may not despair over matters that pass you by, nor exultover favours bestowed upon you. For Allah loveth not any vainglorious boaster,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Such persons as are covetous and commend covetousness to men. And if anyturn back [from Allah's Way], verily Allah is Free of all Needs, Worthy of allPraise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with themthe Book and the Balance [of Right and Wrong], that men may stand forth injustice; and We sent down Iron, in which is [material for] mighty war, as wellas many benefits for mankind, that Allah may test who it is that will help,Unseen, Him and His messengers: For Allah is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might[and able to enforce His Will]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And We sent Noah and Abraham, and established in their line Prophethood andRevelation: and some of them were on right guidance. But many of them becamerebellious transgressors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  Then, in their wake, We followed them up with [others of] Our messengers: Wesent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the Gospel; and Weordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and Mercy. But theMonasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them:[We commanded] only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah; but that theydid not foster as they should have done. Yet We bestowed, on those among themwho believed, their [due] reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  O ye that believe! Fear Allah, and believe in His Messenger, and He willbestow on you a double portion of His Mercy: He will provide for you a Light bywhich ye shall walk [straight in your path], and He will forgive you [yourpast]: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever overthe Grace of Allah, that [His] Grace is [entirely] in His Hand, to bestow it onwhomsoever He wills. For Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding. </p>
