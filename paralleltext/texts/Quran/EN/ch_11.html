<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 11. Hud, or The Prophet Hud </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  A. L. R. [This is] a Book, with verses basic or fundamental [of establishedmeaning], further explained in detail,- from One Who is Wise and Well-acquainted [with all things]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  [It teacheth] that ye should worship none but Allah. [Say]: "Verily I am[sent] unto you from Him to warn and to bring glad tidings: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  "[And to preach thus], 'Seek ye the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Himin repentance; that He may grant you enjoyment, good [and true], for a termappointed, and bestow His abounding grace on all who abound in merit! But if yeturn away, then I fear for you the penalty of a great day: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  'To Allah is your return, and He hath power over all things.'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Behold! they fold up their hearts, that they may lie hid from Him! Ah evenwhen they cover themselves with their garments, He knoweth what they conceal,and what they reveal: for He knoweth well the [inmost secrets] of the hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependeth on Allah:He knoweth the time and place of its definite abode and its temporary deposit:All is in a clear Record. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Thronewas over the waters - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct.But if thou wert to say to them, "Ye shall indeed be raised up after death", theUnbelievers would be sure to say, "This is nothing but obvious sorcery!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say,"What keeps it back?" Ah! On the day it [actually] reaches them, nothing willturn it away from them, and they will be completely encircled by that which theyused to mock at! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  If We give man a taste of Mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it fromhim, behold! he is in despair and [falls into] blasphemy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  But if We give him a taste of [Our] favours after adversity hath touchedhim, he is sure to say, "All evil has departed from me:" Behold! he falls intoexultation and pride. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness; forthem is forgiveness [of sins] and a great reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Perchance thou mayest [feel the inclination] to give up a part of what isrevealed unto thee, and thy heart feeleth straitened lest they say, "Why is nota treasure sent down unto him, or why does not an angel come down with him?" Butthou art there only to warn! It is Allah that arrangeth all affairs! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Or they may say, "He forged it," Say, "Bring ye then ten Suras forged, likeunto it, and call [to your aid] whomsoever ye can, other than Allah!- If yespeak the truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  "If then they [your false gods] answer not your [call], know ye that thisrevelation is sent down [replete] with the knowledge of Allah, and that there isno god but He! will ye even then submit [to Islam]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter,- to them we shallpay [the price of] their deeds therein,- without diminution. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: vainare the designs they frame therein, and of no effect and the deeds that they do! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Can they be [like] those who accept a Clear [Sign] from their Lord, and whoma witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it,- a guideand a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- theFire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for itis the truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Who doth more wrong than those who invent a life against Allah? They will beturned back to the presence of their Lord, and the witnesses will say, "Theseare the ones who lied against their Lord! Behold! the Curse of Allah is on thosewho do wrong!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  "Those who would hinder [men] from the path of Allah and would seek in itsomething crooked: these were they who denied the Hereafter!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  They will in no wise frustrate [His design] on earth, nor have theyprotectors besides Allah! Their penalty will be doubled! They lost the power tohear, and they did not see! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  They are the ones who have lost their own souls: and the [fancies] theyinvented have left them in the lurch! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Without a doubt, these are the very ones who will lose most in theHereafter! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  But those who believe and work righteousness, and humble themselves beforetheir Lord,- They will be companions of the gardens, to dwell therein for aye! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  These two kinds [of men] may be compared to the blind and deaf, and thosewho can see and hear well. Are they equal when compared? Will ye not then takeheed? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  We sent Noah to his people [with a mission]: "I have come to you with aClear Warning: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  "That ye serve none but Allah: Verily I do fear for you the penalty of agrievous day." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  But the chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: "We see [in] theenothing but a man like ourselves: Nor do we see that any follow thee but themeanest among us, in judgment immature: Nor do we see in you [all] any meritabove us: in fact we thing ye are liars!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  He said: "O my people! See ye if [it be that] I have a Clear Sign from myLord, and that He hath sent Mercy unto me from His own presence, but that theMercy hath been obscured from your sight? shall we compel you to accept it whenye are averse to it? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "And O my people! I ask you for no wealth in return: my reward is from nonebut Allah: But I will not drive away [in contempt] those who believe: for verilythey are to meet their Lord, and ye I see are the ignorant ones! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  "And O my people! who would help me against Allah if I drove them away? Willye not then take heed? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  "I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know whatis hidden, nor claim I to be an angel. Nor yet do I say, of those whom your eyesdo despise that Allah will not grant them [all] that is good: Allah knoweth bestwhat is in their souls: I should, if I did, indeed be a wrong-doer." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  They said: "O Noah! thou hast disputed with us, and [much] hast thouprolonged the dispute with us: now bring upon us what thou threatenest us with,if thou speakest the truth!?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  He said: "Truly, Allah will bring it on you if He wills,- and then, ye willnot be able to frustrate it! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  "Of no profit will be my counsel to you, much as I desire to give you [good]counsel, if it be that Allah willeth to leave you astray: He is your Lord! andto Him will ye return!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say: "If I had forged it, on me were mysin! and I am free of the sins of which ye are guilty! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  It was revealed to Noah: "None of thy people will believe except those whohave believed already! So grieve no longer over their [evil] deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  "But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no[further] on behalf of those who are in sin: for they are about to beoverwhelmed [in the Flood]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Forthwith he [starts] constructing the Ark: Every time that the chiefs ofhis people passed by him, they threw ridicule on him. He said: "If ye ridiculeus now, we [in our turn] can look down on you with ridicule likewise! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  "But soon will ye know who it is on whom will descend a penalty that willcover them with shame,- on whom will be unloosed a penalty lasting:" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  At length, behold! there came Our command, and the fountains of the earthgushed forth! We said: "Embark therein, of each kind two, male and female, andyour family - except those against whom the word has already gone forth,- andthe Believers." but only a few believed with him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  So he said: "Embark ye on the Ark, In the name of Allah, whether it move orbe at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  So the Ark floated with them on the waves [towering] like mountains, andNoah called out to his son, who had separated himself [from the rest]: "O myson! embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  The son replied: "I will betake myself to some mountain: it will save mefrom the water." Noah said: "This day nothing can save, from the command ofAllah, any but those on whom He hath mercy! "And the waves came between them,and the son was among those overwhelmed in the Flood. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Then the word went forth: "O earth! swallow up thy water, and O sky!Withhold [thy rain]!" and the water abated, and the matter was ended. The Arkrested on Mount Judi, and the word went forth: "Away with those who do wrong!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: "O my Lord! surely my son is of myfamily! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the justest of Judges!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  He said: "O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous.So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lestthou act like the ignorant!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Noah said: "O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee, lest I ask Thee for thatof which I have no knowledge. And unless thou forgive me and have Mercy on me, Ishould indeed be lost!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  The word came: "O Noah! Come down [from the Ark] with peace from Us, andblessing on thee and on some of the peoples [who will spring] from those withthee: but [there will be other] peoples to whom We shall grant their pleasures[for a time], but in the end will a grievous penalty reach them from Us." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which We have revealed untothee: before this, neither thou nor thy people knew them. So perseverepatiently: for the End is for those who are righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  To the 'Ad People [We sent] Hud, one of their own brethren. He said: "O mypeople! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him. [Your other gods] ye donothing but invent! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  "O my people! I ask of you no reward for this [Message]. My reward is fromnone but Him who created me: Will ye not then understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  "And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him [inrepentance]: He will send you the skies pouring abundant rain, and add strengthto your strength: so turn ye not back in sin!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  They said: "O Hud! No Clear [Sign] that hast thou brought us, and we are notthe ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  "We say nothing but that [perhaps] some of our gods may have seized theewith imbecility." He said: "I call Allah to witness, and do ye bear witness,that I am free from the sin of ascribing, to Him, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  "Other gods as partners! so scheme [your worst] against me, all of you, andgive me no respite. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  "I put my trust in Allah, My Lord and your Lord! There is not a movingcreature, but He hath grasp of its fore-lock. Verily, it is my Lord that is on astraight Path. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  "If ye turn away,- I [at least] have conveyed the Message with which I wassent to you. My Lord will make another people to succeed you, and you will notharm Him in the least. For my Lord hath care and watch over all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  So when Our decree issued, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by[special] Grace from Ourselves: We saved them from a severe penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  Such were the 'Ad People: they rejected the Signs of their Lord andCherisher; disobeyed His messengers; And followed the command of every powerful,obstinate transgressor. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  And they were pursued by a Curse in this life,- and on the Day of Judgment.Ah! Behold! for the 'Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed[from sight] were 'Ad the people of Hud! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  To the Thamud People [We sent] Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: "Omy people! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hathproduced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness ofHim, and turn to Him [in repentance]: for my Lord is [always] near, ready toanswer." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  They said: "O Salih! thou hast been of us! a centre of our hopes hitherto!dost thou [now] forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped? But we arereally in suspicious [disquieting] doubt as to that to which thou invitest us." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  He said: "O my people! do ye see? if I have a Clear [Sign] from my Lord andHe hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself,- who then can help me against Allah ifI were to disobey Him? What then would ye add to my [portion] but perdition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  "And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a symbol to you: leave her tofeed on Allah's [free] earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penaltywill seize you!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  But they did ham-string her. So he said: "Enjoy yourselves in your homes forthree days: [Then will be your ruin]: [Behold] there a promise not to bebelied!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  When Our Decree issued, We saved Salih and those who believed with him, by[special] Grace from Ourselves - and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">-He is the Strong One, and able to enforce His Will.  67.  The [mighty] Blast overtook the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in theirhomes before the morning,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  As if they had never dwelt and flourished there. Ah! Behold! for the Thamudrejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed [from sight] were theThamud! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  There came Our messengers to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, "Peace!"He answered, "Peace!" and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  But when he saw their hands went not towards the [meal], he felt somemistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: "Fear not: We havebeen sent against the people of Lut." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  And his wife was standing [there], and she laughed: But we gave her gladtidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  She said: "Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, andmy husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  They said: "Dost thou wonder at Allah's decree? The grace of Allah and Hisblessings on you, o ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of allpraise, full of all glory!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  When fear had passed from [the mind of] Abraham and the glad tidings hadreached him, he began to plead with us for Lut's people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing [of faults], compassionate, andgiven to look to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  O Abraham! Seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth: for themthere cometh a penalty that cannot be turned back! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  When Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account and felthimself powerless [to protect] them. He said: "This is a distressful day." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habitof practising abominations. He said: "O my people! Here are my daughters: theyare purer for you [if ye marry]! Now fear Allah, and cover me not with shameabout my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  They said: "Well dost thou know we have no need of thy daughters: indeedthou knowest quite well what we want!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  He said: "Would that I had power to suppress you or that I could betakemyself to some powerful support." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  [The Messengers] said: "O Lut! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no meansshall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the nightremains, and let not any of you look back: but thy wife [will remain behind]: Toher will happen what happens to the people. Morning is their time appointed: Isnot the morning nigh?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  When Our Decree issued, We turned [the cities] upside down, and rained downon them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  Marked as from thy Lord: Nor are they ever far from those who do wrong! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  To the Madyan People [We sent] Shu'aib, one of their own brethren: he said:"O my people! worship Allah: Ye have no other god but Him. And give not shortmeasure or weight: I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the penalty of aday that will compass [you] all round. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  "And O my people! give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the peoplethe things that are their due: commit not evil in the land with intent to domischief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  "That which is left you by Allah is best for you, if ye [but] believed! butI am not set over you to keep watch!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  They said: "O Shu'aib! Does thy [religion of] prayer command thee that weleave off the worship which our fathers practised, or that we leave off doingwhat we like with our property? truly, thou art the one that forbeareth withfaults and is right-minded!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  He said: "O my people! see ye whether I have a Clear [Sign] from my Lord,and He hath given me sustenance [pure and] good as from Himself? I wish not, inopposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do. I only desire [your]betterment to the best of my power; and my success [in my task] can only comefrom Allah. In Him I trust, and unto Him I look. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  "And O my people! let not my dissent [from you] cause you to sin, lest yesuffer a fate similar to that of the people of Noah or of Hud or of Salih, norare the people of Lut far off from you! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  "But ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn unto Him [in repentance]: For myLord is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  They said: "O Shu'aib! much of what thou sayest we do not understand! Infact among us we see that thou hast no strength! Were it not for thy family, weshould certainly have stoned thee! for thou hast among us no great position!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  He said: "O my people! is then my family of more consideration with you thanAllah? For ye cast Him away behind your backs [with contempt]. But verily myLord encompasseth on all sides all that ye do! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  "And O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do [my part]: Soon will ye knowwho it is on whom descends the penalty of ignominy; and who is a liar! and watchye! for I too am watching with you!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  When Our decree issued, We saved Shu'aib and those who believed with him, by[special] mercy from Ourselves: But the [mighty] blast did seize the wrong­doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  As if they had never dwelt and flourished there! Ah! Behold! How the Madyanwere removed [from sight] as were removed the Thamud! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  And we sent Moses, with Our Clear [Signs] and an authority manifest, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">97.  Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: but they followed the command of Pharaoh andthe command of Pharaoh was no right [guide]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">98.  He will go before his people on the Day of Judgment, and lead them into theFire [as cattle are led to water]: But woeful indeed will be the place to whichthey are led! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">99.  And they are followed by a curse in this [life] and on the Day of Judgment:and woeful is the gift which shall be given [unto them]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">100.  These are some of the stories of communities which We relate unto thee: of them some are standing, and some have been mown down [by the sickle of time]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">101.  It was not We that wronged them: They wronged their own souls: the deities,other than Allah, whom they invoked, profited them no whit when there issued thedecree of thy Lord: Nor did they add aught [to their lot] but perdition! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">102.  Such is the chastisement of thy Lord when He chastises communities in themidst of their wrong: grievous, indeed, and severe is His chastisement. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">103.  In that is a Sign for those who fear the penalty of the Hereafter: that isa Day for which mankind will be gathered together: that will be a Day ofTestimony. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">104.  Nor shall We delay it but for a term appointed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">105.  The day it arrives, no soul shall speak except by His leave: of those[gathered] some will be wretched and some will be blessed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">106.  Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein [nothing but] the heaving of sighs and sobs: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">107.  They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earthendure, except as thy Lord willeth: for thy Lord is the [sure] accomplisher ofwhat He planneth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">108.  And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden: They will dwell thereinfor all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lordwilleth: a gift without break. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">109.  Be not then in doubt as to what these men worship. They worship nothing butwhat their fathers worshipped before [them]: but verily We shall pay them back[in full] their portion without [the least] abatement. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">110.  We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose therein: had itnot been that a word had gone forth before from thy Lord, the matter would havebeen decided between them, but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">111.  And, of a surety, to all will your Lord pay back [in full the recompense]of their deeds: for He knoweth well all that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">112.  Therefore stand firm [in the straight Path] as thou art commanded,- thouand those who with thee turn [unto Allah]; and transgress not [from the Path]:for He seeth well all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">113.  And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and yehave no protectors other than Allah, nor shall ye be helped. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">114.  And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at theapproaches of the night: For those things, that are good remove those that areevil: Be that the word of remembrance to those who remember [their Lord]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">115.  And be steadfast in patience; for verily Allah will not suffer the rewardof the righteous to perish. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">116.  Why were there not, among the generations before you, persons possessed ofbalanced good sense, prohibiting [men] from mischief in the earth - except a fewamong them whom We saved [from harm]? But the wrong-doers pursued the enjoymentof the good things of life which were given them, and persisted in sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">117.  Nor would thy Lord be the One to destroy communities for a single wrong­doing, if its members were likely to mend. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">118.  If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one people: but theywill not cease to dispute. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">119.  Except those on whom thy Lord hath bestowed His Mercy: and for this did Hecreate them: and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: "I will fill Hell withjinns and men all together." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">120.  All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers,- with it Wemake firm thy heart: in them there cometh to thee the Truth, as well as anexhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="122">121.  Say to those who do not believe: "Do what ever ye can: We shall do ourpart; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">122.  "And wait ye! We too shall wait." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">123.  To Allah do belong the unseen [secrets] of the heavens and the earth, andto Him goeth back every affair [for decision]: then worship Him, and put thytrust in Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do. </p>
