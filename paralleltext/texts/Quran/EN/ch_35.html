<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 35. Fatir, or The Originator of Creation; or </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">Malaika, or The Angels </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">1.  Praise be to Allah, Who created [out of nothing] the heavens and the earth,Who made the angels, messengers with wings,- two, or three, or four [pairs]: Headds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">2.  What Allah out of his Mercy doth bestow on mankind there is none canwithhold: what He doth withhold, there is none can grant, apart from Him: and Heis the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">3.  O men! Call to mind the grace of Allah unto you! is there a creator, otherthan Allah, to give you sustenance from heaven or earth? There is no god but He:how then are ye deluded away from the Truth? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">4.  And if they reject thee, so were messengers rejected before thee: to Allahback for decision all affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">5.  O men! Certainly the promise of Allah is true. Let not then this present lifedeceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">6.  Verily Satan is an enemy to you: so treat him as an enemy. He only inviteshis adherents, that they may become Companions of the Blazing Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">7.  For those who reject Allah, is a terrible Penalty: but for those who believeand work righteous deeds, is Forgiveness, and a magnificent Reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">8.  Is he, then, to whom the evil of his conduct is made alluring, so that helooks upon it as good, [equal to one who is rightly guided]? For Allah leaves tostray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. So let not thy soul go out in[vainly] sighing after them: for Allah knows well all that they do! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">9.  It is Allah Who sends forth the Winds, so that they raise up the Clouds, andWe drive them to a land that is dead, and revive the earth therewith after itsdeath: even so [will be] the Resurrection! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">10.  If any do seek for glory and power,- to Allah belong all glory and power. ToHim mount up [all] Words of Purity: It is He Who exalts each Deed ofRighteousness. Those that lay Plots of Evil,- for them is a Penalty terrible;and the plotting of such will be void [of result]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">11.  And Allah did create you from dust; then from a sperm-drop; then He made youin pairs. And no female conceives, or lays down [her load], but with Hisknowledge. Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days, nor is a part cut offfrom his life, but is in a Decree [ordained]. All this is easy to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">12.  Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike,- the one palatable, sweet,and pleasant to drink, and the other, salt and bitter. Yet from each [kind ofwater] do ye eat flesh fresh and tender, and ye extract ornaments to wear; andthou seest the ships therein that plough the waves, that ye may seek [thus] ofthe Bounty of Allah that ye may be grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">13.  He merges Night into Day, and he merges Day into Night, and he has subjectedthe sun and the moon [to his Law]: each one runs its course for a termappointed. Such is Allah your Lord: to Him belongs all Dominion. And those whomye invoke besides Him have not the least power. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">14.  If ye invoke them, they will not listen to your call, and if they were tolisten, they cannot answer your [prayer]. On the Day of Judgment they will </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">reject your "Partnership". and none, [O man!] can tell thee [the Truth] like theOne Who is acquainted with all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">15.  O ye men! It is ye that have need of Allah: but Allah is the One Free of allwants, worthy of all praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">16.  If He so pleased, He could blot you out and bring in a New Creation. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">17.  Nor is that [at all] difficult for Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">18.  Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another's burdens if one heavily ladenshould call another to [bear] his load. Not the least portion of it can becarried [by the other]. Even though he be nearly related. Thou canst butadmonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. Andwhoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul; and thedestination [of all] is to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">19.  The blind and the seeing are not alike; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">20.  Nor are the depths of Darkness and the Light; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">21.  Nor are the [chilly] shade and the [genial] heat of the sun: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">22.  Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead. Allah can makeany that He wills to hear; but thou canst not make those to hear who are[buried] in graves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">23.  Thou art no other than a warner. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">24.  Verily We have sent thee in truth, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as awarner: and there never was a people, without a warner having lived among them[in the past]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">25.  And if they reject thee, so did their predecessors, to whom came theirmessengers with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book ofEnlightenment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">26.  In the end did I punish those who rejected Faith: and how [terrible] was Myrejection [of them]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">27.  Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky? With it We thenbring out produce of various colours. And in the mountains are tracts white andred, of various shades of colour, and black intense in hue. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">28.  And so amongst men and crawling creatures and cattle, are they of variouscolours. Those truly fear Allah, among His Servants, who have knowledge: forAllah is Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">29.  Those who rehearse the Book of Allah, establish regular Prayer, and spend[in Charity] out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hopefor a commerce that will never fail: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">30.  For He will pay them their meed, nay, He will give them [even] more out ofHis Bounty: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate [service]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">31.  That which We have revealed to thee of the Book is the Truth,- confirmingwhat was [revealed] before it: for Allah is assuredly- with respect to HisServants - well acquainted and Fully Observant. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">32.  Then We have given the Book for inheritance to such of Our Servants as Wehave chosen: but there are among them some who wrong their own souls; some whofollow a middle course; and some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in gooddeeds; that is the highest Grace. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">33.  Gardens of Eternity will they enter: therein will they be adorned withbracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">34.  And they will say: "Praise be to Allah, Who has removed from us [all]sorrow: for our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving Ready to appreciate [service]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">35.  "Who has, out of His Bounty, settled us in a Home that will last: no toilnor sense of weariness shall touch us therein." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">36.  But those who reject [Allah] - for them will be the Fire of Hell: No termshall be determined for them, so they should die, nor shall its Penalty belightened for them. Thus do We reward every ungrateful one! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">37.  Therein will they cry aloud [for assistance]: "Our Lord! Bring us out: weshall work righteousness, not the [deeds] we used to do!" - "Did We not give youlong enough life so that he that would should receive admonition? and [moreover]the warner came to you. So taste ye [the fruits of your deeds]: for the wrong­doers there is no helper." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">38.  Verily Allah knows [all] the hidden things of the heavens and the earth:verily He has full knowledge of all that is in [men's] hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">39.  He it is That has made you inheritors in the earth: if, then, any do reject[Allah], their rejection [works] against themselves: their rejection but adds tothe odium for the Unbelievers in the sight of their Lord: their rejection butadds to [their own] undoing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">40.  Say: "Have ye seen [these] 'Partners' of yours whom ye call upon besidesAllah? Show Me what it is they have created in the [wide] earth. Or have they ashare in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book from which they [can derive]clear [evidence]?- Nay, the wrong-doers promise each other nothing butdelusions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">41.  It is Allah Who sustains the heavens and the earth, lest they cease [tofunction]: and if they should fail, there is none - not one - can sustain themthereafter: Verily He is Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">42.  They swore their strongest oaths by Allah that if a warner came to them,they would follow his guidance better than any [other] of the Peoples: But whena warner came to them, it has only increased their flight [from righteousness],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">43.  On account of their arrogance in the land and their plotting of Evil, butthe plotting of Evil will hem in only the authors thereof. Now are they butlooking for the way the ancients were dealt with? But no change wilt thou findin Allah's way [of dealing]: no turning off wilt thou find in Allah's way [ofdealing]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">44.  Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of thosebefore them,- though they were superior to them in strength? Nor is Allah to befrustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth: for He is All-Knowing. All-Powerful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">45.  If Allah were to punish men according to what they deserve. He would notleave on the back of the [earth] a single living creature: but He gives themrespite for a stated Term: when their Term expires, verily Allah has in Hissight all His Servants. </p>
