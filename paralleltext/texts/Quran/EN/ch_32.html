<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 32. Sajda, or Adoration </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Alif, Lam, Mim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  [This is] the Revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt,- from theLord of the Worlds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Nay, it is the Truth from thy Lord, thatthou mayest admonish a people to whom no warner has come before thee: in orderthat they may receive guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  It is Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all between them,in six Days, and is firmly established on the Throne [of Authority]: ye havenone, besides Him, to protect or intercede [for you]: will ye not then receiveadmonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  He rules [all] affairs from the heavens to the earth: in the end will [allaffairs] go up to Him, on a Day, the space whereof will be [as] a thousand yearsof your reckoning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Such is He, the Knower of all things, hidden and open, the Exalted [inpower], the Merciful;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  He Who has made everything which He has created most good: He began thecreation of man with [nothing more than] clay, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  And made his progeny from a quintessence of the nature of a fluid despised: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  But He fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him something ofHis spirit. And He gave you [the faculties of] hearing and sight and feeling[and understanding]: little thanks do ye give! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And they say: "What! when we lie, hidden and lost, in the earth, shall weindeed be in a Creation renewed? Nay, they deny the Meeting with their Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Say: "The Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will [duly] take your souls:then shall ye be brought back to your Lord." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  If only thou couldst see when the guilty ones will bend low their headsbefore their Lord, [saying:] "Our Lord! We have seen and we have heard: Now thensend us back [to the world]: we will work righteousness: for we do indeed [now]believe." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  If We had so willed, We could certainly have brought every soul its trueguidance: but the Word from Me will come true, "I will fill Hell with Jinns andmen all together." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  "Taste ye then - for ye forgot the Meeting of this Day of yours, and We toowill forget you - taste ye the Penalty of Eternity for your [evil] deeds!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Only those believe in Our Signs, who, when they are recited to them, falldown in prostration, and celebrate the praises of their Lord, nor are they[ever] puffed up with pride. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Their limbs do forsake their beds of sleep, the while they call on theirLord, in Fear and Hope: and they spend [in charity] out of the sustenance whichWe have bestowed on them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Now no person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden [in reserve]for them - as a reward for their [good] deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Is then the man who believes no better than the man who is rebellious and wicked? Not equal are they. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  For those who believe and do righteous deeds are Gardens as hospitablehomes, for their [good] deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  As to those who are rebellious and wicked, their abode will be the Fire:every time they wish to get away therefrom, they will be forced There into, andit will be said to them: "Taste ye the Penalty of the Fire, the which ye werewont to reject as false." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And indeed We will make them taste of the Penalty of this [life] prior tothe supreme Penalty, in order that they may [repent and] return. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  And who does more wrong than one to whom are recited the Signs of his Lord,and who then turns away therefrom? Verily from those who transgress We shallexact [due] Retribution. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  We did indeed aforetime give the Book to Moses: be not then in doubt of itsreaching [thee]: and We made it a guide to the Children of Israel. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  And We appointed, from among them, leaders, giving guidance under Ourcommand, so long as they persevered with patience and continued to have faith inOur Signs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, in thematters wherein they differ [among themselves] </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Does it not teach them a lesson, how many generations We destroyed beforethem, in whose dwellings they [now] go to and fro? Verily in that are Signs: Dothey not then listen? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And do they not see that We do drive rain to parched soil [bare of herbage],and produce therewith crops, providing food for their cattle and themselves?Have they not the vision? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  They say: "When will this decision be, if ye are telling the truth?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Say: "On the Day of Decision, no profit will it be to Unbelievers if they[then] believe! nor will they be granted a respite." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  So turn away from them, and wait: they too are waiting. </p>
