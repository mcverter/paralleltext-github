<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 36. Ya-Sin </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Ya Sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  By the Qur'an, full of Wisdom,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Thou art indeed one of the messengers, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  On a Straight Way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  It is a Revelation sent down by [Him], the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  In order that thou mayest admonish a people, whose fathers had received noadmonition, and who therefore remain heedless [of the Signs of Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  The Word is proved true against the greater part of them: for they do notbelieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  We have put yokes round their necks right up to their chins, so that theirheads are forced up [and they cannot see]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And We have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them, and further, Wehave covered them up; so that they cannot see. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  The same is it to them whether thou admonish them or thou do not admonish them: they will not believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Thou canst but admonish such a one as follows the Message and fears the[Lord] Most Gracious, unseen: give such a one, therefore, good tidings, ofForgiveness and a Reward most generous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Verily We shall give life to the dead, and We record that which they sendbefore and that which they leave behind, and of all things have We taken accountin a clear Book [of evidence]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Set forth to them, by way of a parable, the [story of] the Companions of theCity. Behold!, there came messengers to it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  When We [first] sent to them two messengers, they rejected them: But Westrengthened them with a third: they said, "Truly, we have been sent on amission to you." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  The [people] said: "Ye are only men like ourselves; and [Allah] MostGracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  They said: "Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  "And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  The [people] said: "for us, we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desistnot, we will certainly stone you. And a grievous punishment indeed will beinflicted on you by us." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  They said: "Your evil omens are with yourselves: [deem ye this an evilomen]. If ye are admonished? Nay, but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Then there came running, from the farthest part of the City, a man, saying,"O my people! Obey the messengers: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  "Obey those who ask no reward of you [for themselves], and who havethemselves received Guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  "It would not be reasonable in me if I did not serve Him Who created me, andto Whom ye shall [all] be brought back. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  "Shall I take [other] gods besides Him? If [Allah] Most Gracious shouldintend some adversity for me, of no use whatever will be their intercession forme, nor can they deliver me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  "I would indeed, if I were to do so, be in manifest Error. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  "For me, I have faith in the Lord of you [all]: listen, then, to me!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  It was said: "Enter thou the Garden." He said: "Ah me! Would that my Peopleknew [what I know]!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "For that my Lord has granted me Forgiveness and has enrolled me among thoseheld in honour!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  And We sent not down against his People, after him, any hosts from heaven,nor was it needful for Us so to do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  It was no more than a single mighty Blast, and behold! they were [likeashes] quenched and silent. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Ah! Alas for [My] Servants! There comes not a messenger to them but theymock him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  See they not how many generations before them we destroyed? Not to them willthey return: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  But each one of them all - will be brought before Us [for judgment]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  A Sign for them is the earth that is dead: We do give it life, and producegrain therefrom, of which ye do eat. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  And We produce therein orchard with date-palms and vines, and We causesprings to gush forth therein: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  That they may enjoy the fruits of this [artistry]: It was not their handsthat made this: will they not then give thanks? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Glory to Allah, Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces, aswell as their own [human] kind and [other] things of which they have noknowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  And a Sign for them is the Night: We withdraw therefrom the Day, and beholdthey are plunged in darkness; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  And the sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is thedecree of [Him], the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  And the Moon,- We have measured for her mansions [to traverse] till shereturns like the old [and withered] lower part of a date-stalk. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  It is not permitted to the Sun to catch up the Moon, nor can the Nightoutstrip the Day: Each [just] swims along in [its own] orbit [according to Law]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">341. And a Sign for them is that We bore their race [through the Flood] in theloaded Ark;  42.  And We have created for them similar [vessels] on which they ride. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">43.  If it were Our Will, We could drown them: then would there be no helper [tohear their cry], nor could they be delivered, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">44.  Except by way of Mercy from Us, and by way of [world] convenience [to servethem] for a time. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">45.  When they are told, "Fear ye that which is before you and that which will beafter you, in order that ye may receive Mercy," [they turn back]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">46.  Not a Sign comes to them from among the Signs of their Lord, but they turnaway therefrom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">47.  And when they are told, "Spend ye of [the bounties] with which Allah hasprovided you," the Unbelievers say to those who believe: "Shall we then feedthose whom, if Allah had so willed, He would have fed, [Himself]?- Ye are innothing but manifest error." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">48.  Further, they say, "When will this promise [come to pass], if what ye say istrue?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">49.  They will not [have to] wait for aught but a single Blast: it will seizethem while they are yet disputing among themselves! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">50.  No [chance] will they then have, by will, to dispose [of their affairs], norto return to their own people! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">51.  The trumpet shall be sounded, when behold! from the sepulchres [men] willrush forth to their Lord! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">52.  They will say: "Ah! Woe unto us! Who hath raised us up from our beds ofrepose?"... [A voice will say:] "This is what [Allah] Most Gracious hadpromised. And true was the word of the messengers!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">53.  It will be no more than a single Blast, when lo! they will all be brought upbefore Us! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">54.  Then, on that Day, not a soul will be wronged in the least, and ye shall butbe repaid the meeds of your past Deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">55.  Verily the Companions of the Garden shall that Day have joy in all that theydo; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">56.  They and their associates will be in groves of [cool] shade, reclining onThrones [of dignity]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">57.  [Every] fruit [enjoyment] will be there for them; they shall have whateverthey call for; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">58.  "Peace!" - a word [of salutation] from a Lord Most Merciful! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">59.  "And O ye in sin! Get ye apart this Day! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">60.  "Did I not enjoin on you, O ye Children of Adam, that ye should not worshipSatan; for that he was to you an enemy avowed?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">61.  "And that ye should worship Me, [for that] this was the Straight Way? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">62.  "But he did lead astray a great multitude of you. Did ye not, then,understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">63.  "This is the Hell of which ye were [repeatedly] warned! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">64.  "Embrace ye the [fire] this Day, for that ye [persistently] rejected[Truth]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">65.  That Day shall We set a seal on their mouths. But their hands will speak tous, and their feet bear witness, to all that they did. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">66.  If it had been our Will, We could surely have blotted out their eyes; thenshould they have run about groping for the Path, but how could they have seen? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">67.  And if it had been Our Will, We could have transformed them [to remain] intheir places; then should they have been unable to move about, nor could theyhave returned [after error]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">68.  If We grant long life to any, We cause him to be reversed in nature: Willthey not then understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">69.  We have not instructed the [Prophet] in Poetry, nor is it meet for him: thisis no less than a Message and a Qur'an making things clear: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">70.  That it may give admonition to any [who are] alive, and that the charge maybe proved against those who reject [Truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">71.  See they not that it is We Who have created for them - among the thingswhich Our hands have fashioned - cattle, which are under their dominion?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">72.  And that We have subjected them to their [use]? of them some do carry themand some they eat: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">73.  And they have [other] profits from them [besides], and they get [milk] todrink. Will they not then be grateful? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">74.  Yet they take [for worship] gods other than Allah, [hoping] that they mightbe helped! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">75.  They have not the power to help them: but they will be brought up [beforeOur Judgment-seat] as a troop [to be condemned]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">76.  Let not their speech, then, grieve thee. Verily We know what they hide aswell as what they disclose. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">77.  Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm? yet behold! he[stands forth] as an open adversary! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">78.  And he makes comparisons for Us, and forgets his own [origin and] Creation:He says, "Who can give life to [dry] bones and decomposed ones [at that]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">79.  Say, "He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He isWell-versed in every kind of creation!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">80.  "The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold! yekindle therewith [your own fires]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">81.  "Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like thereof?" - Yea, indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme, of skill and knowledge[infinite]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">82.  Verily, when He intends a thing, His Command is, "be", and it is! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">83.  So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things: and to Himwill ye be all brought back. </p>
