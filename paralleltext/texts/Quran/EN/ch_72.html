<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Say: It has been revealed to me that a company of Jinns listened [to theQur'an]. They said, 'We have really heard a wonderful Recital! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  'It gives guidance to the Right, and we have believed therein: we shall notjoin [in worship] any [gods] with our Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  'And Exalted is the Majesty of our Lord: He has taken neither a wife nor ason. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  'There were some foolish ones among us, who used to utter extravagant liesagainst Allah; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  'But we do think that no man or spirit should say aught that untrue againstAllah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  'True, there were persons among mankind who took shelter with persons amongthe Jinns, but they increased them in folly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  'And they [came to] think as ye thought, that Allah would not raise up anyone [to Judgment]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  'And we pried into the secrets of heaven; but we found it filled with sternguards and flaming fires. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  'We used, indeed, to sit there in [hidden] stations, to [steal] a hearing;but any who listen now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  'And we understand not whether ill is intended to those on earth, or whethertheir Lord [really] intends to guide them to right conduct. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  'There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary: wefollow divergent paths. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  'But we think that we can by no means frustrate Allah throughout the earth,nor can we frustrate Him by flight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  'And as for us, since we have listened to the Guidance, we have accepted it:and any who believes in his Lord has no fear, either of a short [account] or ofany injustice. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  'Amongst us are some that submit their wills [to Allah], and some thatswerve from justice. Now those who submit their wills - they have sought out[the path] of right conduct: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  'But those who swerve,- they are [but] fuel for Hell-fire'-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  [And Allah's Message is]: "If they [the Pagans] had [only] remained on the[right] Way, We should certainly have bestowed on them Rain in abundance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  "That We might try them by that [means]. But if any turns away from theremembrance of his Lord, He will cause him to undergo a severe Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  "And the places of worship are for Allah [alone]: So invoke not any onealong with Allah; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  "Yet when the Devotee of Allah stands forth to invoke Him, they just makeround him a dense crowd." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Say: "I do no more than invoke my Lord, and I join not with Him any [falsegod]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Say: "It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to rightconduct." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Say: "No one can deliver me from Allah [If I were to disobey Him], norshould I find refuge except in Him, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  "Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His Messages: for any thatdisobey Allah and His Messenger,- for them is Hell: they shall dwell therein forever." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  At length, when they see [with their own eyes] that which they arepromised,- then will they know who it is that is weakest in [his] helper andleast important in point of numbers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Say: "I know not whether the [Punishment] which ye are promised is near, orwhether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  "He [alone] knows the Unseen, nor does He make any one acquainted with HisMysteries,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "Except a messenger whom He has chosen: and then He makes a band of watchersmarch before him and behind him, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  "That He may know that they have [truly] brought and delivered the Messagesof their Lord: and He surrounds [all the mysteries] that are with them, andtakes account of every single thing." </p>
