<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 79. Naziat, or Those Who Tear Out </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  By the [angels] who tear out [the souls of the wicked] with violence; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  By those who gently draw out [the souls of the blessed]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And by those who glide along [on errands of mercy], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Then press forward as in a race, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Then arrange to do [the Commands of their Lord], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  One Day everything that can be in commotion will be in violent commotion, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Followed by oft-repeated [commotions]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Hearts that Day will be in agitation; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Cast down will be [their owners'] eyes. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  They say [now]: "What! shall we indeed be returned to [our] former state? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  "What! - when we shall have become rotten bones?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  They say: "It would, in that case, be a return with loss!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  But verily, it will be but a single [Compelling] Cry, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  When, behold, they will be in the [full] awakening [to Judgment]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Has the story of Moses reached thee? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Behold, thy Lord did call to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  "Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  "And say to him, 'Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified [from sin]?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  "'And that I guide thee to thy Lord, so thou shouldst fear Him?'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Then did [Moses] show him the Great Sign. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  But [Pharaoh] rejected it and disobeyed [guidance]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Further, he turned his back, striving hard [against Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Then he collected [his men] and made a proclamation, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Saying, "I am your Lord, Most High". </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  But Allah did punish him, [and made an] example of him, - in the Hereafter,as in this life. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Verily in this is an instructive warning for whosoever feareth [Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  What! Are ye the more difficult to create or the heaven [above]? [Allah]hath constructed it: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  On high hath He raised its canopy, and He hath given it order andperfection. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Its night doth He endow with darkness, and its splendour doth He bring out[with light]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  And the earth, moreover, hath He extended [to a wide expanse]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  He draweth out therefrom its moisture and its pasture; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And the mountains hath He firmly fixed;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  For use and convenience to you and your cattle. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Therefore, when there comes the great, overwhelming [Event],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  The Day when man shall remember [all] that he strove for, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  And Hell-Fire shall be placed in full view for [all] to see,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Then, for such as had transgressed all bounds, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  And had preferred the life of this world, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  The Abode will be Hell-Fire; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  And for such as had entertained the fear of standing before their Lord's[tribunal] and had restrained [their] soul from lower desires, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Their abode will be the Garden. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  They ask thee about the Hour,-'When will be its appointed time? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  Wherein art thou [concerned] with the declaration thereof? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  With thy Lord in the Limit fixed therefor. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Thou art but a Warner for such as fear it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  The Day they see it, [It will be] as if they had tarried but a singleevening, or [at most till] the following morn! </p>
