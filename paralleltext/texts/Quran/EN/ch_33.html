<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 33. Ahzab, or The Confederates </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  O Prophet! Fear Allah, and hearken not to the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites:verily Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  But follow that which comes to thee by inspiration from thy Lord: for Allahis well acquainted with [all] that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his [one] body: nor has He madeyour wives whom ye divorce by Zihar your mothers: nor has He made your adoptedsons your sons. Such is [only] your [manner of] speech by your mouths. But Allahtells [you] the Truth, and He shows the [right] Way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Call them by [the names of] their fathers: that is juster in the sight ofAllah. But if ye know not their father's [names, call them] your Brothers infaith, or your friends. But there is no blame on you if ye make a mistaketherein: [what counts is] the intention of your hearts: and Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves, and his wivesare their mothers. Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties,in the Decree of Allah. Than [the Brotherhood of] Believers and Muhajirs:nevertheless do ye what is just to your closest friends: such is the writing inthe Decree [of Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  And remember We took from the prophets their covenant: As [We did] from thee:from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemncovenant: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  That [Allah] may question the [custodians] of Truth concerning the Truth they[were charged with]: And He has prepared for the Unbelievers a grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  O ye who believe! Remember the Grace of Allah, [bestowed] on you, when therecame down on you hosts [to overwhelm you]: But We sent against them a hurricaneand forces that ye saw not: but Allah sees [clearly] all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Behold! they came on you from above you and from below you, and behold, theeyes became dim and the hearts gaped up to the throats, and ye imagined various[vain] thoughts about Allah! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  In that situation were the Believers tried: they were shaken as by atremendous shaking. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And behold! The Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease [even]say: "Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Behold! A party among them said: "Ye men of Yathrib! ye cannot stand [theattack]! therefore go back!" And a band of them ask for leave of the Prophet,saying, "Truly our houses are bare and exposed," though they were not exposedthey intended nothing but to run away. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And if an entry had been effected to them from the sides of the [city], andthey had been incited to sedition, they would certainly have brought it to pass,with none but a brief delay! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  And yet they had already covenanted with Allah not to turn their backs, anda covenant with Allah must [surely] be answered for. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Say: "Running away will not profit you if ye are running away from death orslaughter; and even if [ye do escape], no more than a brief [respite] will ye beallowed to enjoy!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Say: "Who is it that can screen you from Allah if it be His wish to give youpunishment or to give you Mercy?" Nor will they find for themselves, besidesAllah, any protector or helper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Verily Allah knows those among you who keep back [men] and those who say totheir brethren, "Come along to us", but come not to the fight except for just alittle while. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Covetous over you. Then when fear comes, thou wilt see them looking to thee,their eyes revolving, like [those of] one over whom hovers death: but when thefear is past, they will smite you with sharp tongues, covetous of goods. Suchmen have no faith, and so Allah has made their deeds of none effect: and that iseasy for Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  They think that the Confederates have not withdrawn; and if the Confederatesshould come [again], they would wish they were in the deserts [wandering] amongthe Bedouins, and seeking news about you [from a safe distance]; and if theywere in your midst, they would fight but little. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern [of conduct]for any one whose hope is in Allah and the Final Day, and who engages much inthe Praise of Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  When the Believers saw the Confederate forces, they said: "This is whatAllah and his Messenger had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger told uswhat was true." And it only added to their faith and their zeal in obedience. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah:of them some have completed their vow [to the extreme], and some [still] wait:but they have never changed [their determination] in the least: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  That Allah may reward the men of Truth for their Truth, and punish theHypocrites if that be His Will, or turn to them in Mercy: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  And Allah turned back the Unbelievers for [all] their fury: no advantage didthey gain; and enough is Allah for the believers in their fight. And Allah isfull of Strength, able to enforce His Will. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And those of the People of the Book who aided them - Allah did take themdown from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. [So that] some yeslew, and some ye made prisoners. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And He made you heirs of their lands, their houses, and their goods, and ofa land which ye had not frequented [before]. And Allah has power over allthings. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  O Prophet! Say to thy Consorts: "If it be that ye desire the life of thisWorld, and its glitter,- then come! I will provide for your enjoyment and setyou free in a handsome manner. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  But if ye seek Allah and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter,verily Allah has prepared for the well-doers amongst you a great reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  O Consorts of the Prophet! If any of you were guilty of evident unseemlyconduct, the Punishment would be doubled to her, and that is easy for Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  But any of you that is devout in the service of Allah and His Messenger, andworks righteousness,- to her shall We grant her reward twice: and We haveprepared for her a generous Sustenance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  O Consorts of the Prophet! Ye are not like any of the [other] women: if yedo fear [Allah], be not too complacent of speech, lest one in whose heart is adisease should be moved with desire: but speak ye a speech [that is] just. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  And stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling display, like thatof the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer, and give regularCharity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah only wishes to remove allabomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure andspotless. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes, of the Signs of Allah andHis Wisdom: for Allah understands the finest mysteries and is well-acquainted[with them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  For Muslim men and women,- for believing men and women, for devout men andwomen, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant,for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in Charity,for men and women who fast [and deny themselves], for men and women who guardtheir chastity, and for men and women who engage much in Allah's praise,- forthem has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  It is not fitting for a Believer, man or woman, when a matter has beendecided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: ifany one disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he is indeed on a clearly wrong Path. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thyfavour: "Retain thou [in wedlock] thy wife, and fear Allah." But thou didst hidein thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear thepeople, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid haddissolved [his marriage] with her, with the necessary [formality], We joined herin marriage to thee: in order that [in future] there may be no difficulty to theBelievers in [the matter of] marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, whenthe latter have dissolved with the necessary [formality] [their marriage] withthem. And Allah's command must be fulfilled. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  There can be no difficulty to the Prophet in what Allah has indicated to himas a duty. It was the practice [approved] of Allah amongst those of old thathave passed away. And the command of Allah is a decree determined. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  [It is the practice of those] who preach the Messages of Allah, and fearHim, and fear none but Allah. And enough is Allah to call [men] to account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] the Messenger ofAllah, and the Seal of the Prophets: and Allah has full knowledge of all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah, and do this often; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  And glorify Him morning and evening. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  He it is Who sends blessings on you, as do His angels, that He may bring youout from the depths of Darkness into Light: and He is Full of Mercy to theBelievers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Their salutation on the Day they meet Him will be "Peace!"; and He hasprepared for them a generous Reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness, a Bearer of Glad Tidings,and Warner,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  And as one who invites to Allah's [grace] by His leave, and as a lampspreading light. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Then give the Glad Tidings to the Believers, that they shall have from Allaha very great Bounty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  And obey not [the behests] of the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and heednot their annoyances, but put thy Trust in Allah. For enough is Allah as aDisposer of affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women, and then divorce thembefore ye have touched them, no period of 'Iddat have ye to count in respect ofthem: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paidtheir dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners ofwar whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles andaunts, and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated [from Makka]with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if theProphet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee, and not for the Believers [atlarge]; We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and thecaptives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be nodifficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  Thou mayest defer [the turn of] any of them that thou pleasest, and thoumayest receive any thou pleasest: and there is no blame on thee if thou inviteone whose [turn] thou hadst set aside. This were nigher to the cooling of theireyes, the prevention of their grief, and their satisfaction - that of all ofthem - with that which thou hast to give them: and Allah knows [all] that is inyour hearts: and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  It is not lawful for thee [to marry more] women after this, nor to changethem for [other] wives, even though their beauty attract thee, except any thyright hand should possess [as handmaidens]: and Allah doth watch over allthings. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses,- until leave is givenyou,- for a meal, [and then] not [so early as] to wait for its preparation: butwhen ye are invited, enter; and when ye have taken your meal, disperse, withoutseeking familiar talk. Such [behaviour] annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed todismiss you, but Allah is not ashamed [to tell you] the truth. And when ye ask[his ladies] for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen: that makes forgreater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that yeshould annoy Allah's Messenger, or that ye should marry his widows after him atany time. Truly such a thing is in Allah's sight an enormity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  Whether ye reveal anything or conceal it, verily Allah has full knowledge ofall things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  There is no blame [on these ladies if they appear] before their fathers ortheir sons, their brothers, or their brother's sons, or their sisters' sons, ortheir women, or the [slaves] whom their right hands possess. And, [ladies], fearAllah; for Allah is Witness to all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe! Sendye blessings on him, and salute him with all respect. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  Those who annoy Allah and His Messenger - Allah has cursed them in thisWorld and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating Punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, bear [onthemselves] a calumny and a glaring sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that theyshould cast their outer garments over their persons [when abroad]: that is mostconvenient, that they should be known [as such] and not molested. And Allah isOft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  Truly, if the Hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and thosewho stir up sedition in the City, desist not, We shall certainly stir thee upagainst them: Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbours for anylength of time: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  They shall have a curse on them: whenever they are found, they shall beseized and slain [without mercy]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  [Such was] the practice [approved] of Allah among those who lived aforetime:No change wilt thou find in the practice [approved] of Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  Men ask thee concerning the Hour: Say, "The knowledge thereof is with Allah[alone]": and what will make thee understand?- perchance the Hour is nigh! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  Verily Allah has cursed the Unbelievers and prepared for them a BlazingFire,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  To dwell therein for ever: no protector will they find, nor helper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  The Day that their faces will be turned upside down in the Fire, they willsay: "Woe to us! Would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  And they would say: "Our Lord! We obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, andthey misled us as to the [right] Path. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  "Our Lord! Give them double Penalty and curse them with a very great Curse!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  O ye who believe! Be ye not like those who vexed and insulted Moses, butAllah cleared him of the [calumnies] they had uttered: and he was honourable inAllah's sight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and [always] say a word directed to the Right: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  That He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: Hethat obeys Allah and His Messenger, has already attained the highestachievement. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof: but manundertook it;- He was indeed unjust and foolish;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  [With the result] that Allah has to punish the Hypocrites, men and women,and the Unbelievers, men and women, and Allah turns in Mercy to the Believers,men and women: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
