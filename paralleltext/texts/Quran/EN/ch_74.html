<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 74. Muddaththir, or One Wrapped Up </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  O thou wrapped up [in the mantle]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Arise and deliver thy warning! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And thy Lord do thou magnify! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And thy garments keep free from stain! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And all abomination shun! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Nor expect, in giving, any increase [for thyself]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  But, for thy Lord's [Cause], be patient and constant! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Finally, when the Trumpet is sounded, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  That will be- that Day - a Day of Distress,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Far from easy for those without Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Leave Me alone, [to deal] with the [creature] whom I created [bare and]alone!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  To whom I granted resources in abundance, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And sons to be by his side!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  To whom I made [life] smooth and comfortable! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Yet is he greedy-that I should add [yet more];-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  By no means! For to Our Signs he has been refractory! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Soon will I visit him with a mount of calamities! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  For he thought and he plotted;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And woe to him! How he plotted!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Yea, Woe to him; How he plotted!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Then he looked round; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Then he frowned and he scowled; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Then he turned back and was haughty; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Then said he: "This is nothing but magic, derived from of old; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  "This is nothing but the word of a mortal!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Soon will I cast him into Hell-Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And what will explain to thee what Hell-Fire is? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Naught doth it permit to endure, and naught doth it leave alone!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Darkening and changing the colour of man! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Over it are Nineteen. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  And We have set none but angels as Guardians of the Fire; and We have fixedtheir number only as a trial for Unbelievers,- in order that the People of theBook may arrive at certainty, and the Believers may increase in Faith,- and thatno doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the Believers, and that </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">those in whose hearts is a disease and the Unbelievers may say, "What symboldoth Allah intend by this?" Thus doth Allah leave to stray whom He pleaseth, andguide whom He pleaseth: and none can know the forces of thy Lord, except He andthis is no other than a warning to mankind. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">32.  Nay, verily: By the Moon, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">33.  And by the Night as it retreateth, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">34.  And by the Dawn as it shineth forth,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">35.  This is but one of the mighty [portents], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">36.  A warning to mankind,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">37.  To any of you that chooses to press forward, or to follow behind;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">38.  Every soul will be [held] in pledge for its deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">39.  Except the Companions of the Right Hand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">40.  [They will be] in Gardens [of Delight]: they will question each other, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">41.  And [ask] of the Sinners: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">42.  "What led you into Hell Fire?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">43.  They will say: "We were not of those who prayed; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">44.  "Nor were we of those who fed the indigent; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">45.  "But we used to talk vanities with vain talkers; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">46.  "And we used to deny the Day of Judgment, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">47.  "Until there came to us [the Hour] that is certain." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">48.  Then will no intercession of [any] intercessors profit them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">49.  Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from admonition?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">50.  As if they were affrighted asses, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">51.  Fleeing from a lion! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">52.  Forsooth, each one of them wants to be given scrolls [of revelation] spreadout! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">53.  By no means! But they fear not the Hereafter, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">54.  Nay, this surely is an admonition: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">55.  Let any who will, keep it in remembrance! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">56.  But none will keep it in remembrance except as Allah wills: He is the Lordof Righteousness, and the Lord of Forgiveness. </p>
