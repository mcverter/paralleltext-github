<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 66. Tahrim, or Holding (something) to be  Forbidden </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which Allah has made lawfulto thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But Allah is Oft- Forgiving, MostMerciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Allah has already ordained for you, [O men], the dissolution of your oaths[in some cases]: and Allah is your Protector, and He is Full of Knowledge andWisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his consorts, andshe then divulged it [to another], and Allah made it known to him, he confirmedpart thereof and repudiated a part. Then when he told her thereof, she said,"Who told thee this? "He said, "He told me Who knows and is well-acquainted[with all things]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  If ye two turn in repentance to Him, your hearts are indeed so inclined; Butif ye back up each other against him, truly Allah is his Protector, and Gabriel,and [every] righteous one among those who believe,- and furthermore, the angels</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">-will back [him] up.  5.  It may be, if he divorced you [all], that Allah will give him in exchangeconsorts better than you,- who submit [their wills], who believe, who aredevout, who turn to Allah in repentance, who worship [in humility], who travel[for Faith] and fast,- previously married or virgins. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  O ye who believe! save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel isMen and Stones, over which are [appointed] angels stern [and] severe, who flinchnot [from executing] the Commands they receive from Allah, but do [precisely]what they are commanded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  [They will say], "O ye Unbelievers! Make no excuses this Day! Ye are beingbut requited for all that ye did!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  O ye who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance: In the hope thatyour Lord will remove from you your ills and admit you to Gardens beneath whichRivers flow,- the Day that Allah will not permit to be humiliated the Prophetand those who believe with him. Their Light will run forward before them and bytheir right hands, while they say, "Our Lord! Perfect our Light for us, andgrant us Forgiveness: for Thou hast power over all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  O Prophet! Strive hard against the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and befirm against them. Their abode is Hell,- an evil refuge [indeed]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Allah sets forth, for an example to the Unbelievers, the wife of Noah andthe wife of Lut: they were [respectively] under two of our righteous servants,but they were false to their [husbands], and they profited nothing before Allahon their account, but were told: "Enter ye the Fire along with [others] thatenter!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  And Allah sets forth, as an example to those who believe the wife ofPharaoh: Behold she said: "O my Lord! Build for me, in nearness to Thee, amansion in the Garden, and save me from Pharaoh and his doings, and save me fromthose that do wrong"; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And Mary the daughter of 'Imran, who guarded her chastity; and We breathedinto [her body] of Our spirit; and she testified to the truth of the words ofher Lord and of His Revelations, and was one of the devout [servants]. </p>
