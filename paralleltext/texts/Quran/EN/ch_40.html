<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 40. Mumin, or The Believer </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Ha Mim </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  The revelation of this Book is from Allah, Exalted in Power, Full ofKnowledge,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Who forgiveth sin, accepteth repentance, is strict in punishment, and hath along reach [in all things]. there is no god but He: to Him is the final goal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  None can dispute about the Signs of Allah but the Unbelievers. Let not, then,their strutting about through the land deceive thee! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  But [there were people] before them, who denied [the Signs],- the People ofNoah, and the Confederates [of Evil] after them; and every People plottedagainst their prophet, to seize him, and disputed by means of vanities,therewith to condemn the Truth; but it was I that seized them! and how[terrible] was My Requital! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Thus was the Decree of thy Lord proved true against the Unbelievers; thattruly they are Companions of the Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Those who sustain the Throne [of Allah] and those around it Sing Glory andPraise to their Lord; believe in Him; and implore Forgiveness for those whobelieve: "Our Lord! Thy Reach is over all things, in Mercy and Knowledge.Forgive, then, those who turn in Repentance, and follow Thy Path; and preservethem from the Penalty of the Blazing Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  "And grant, our Lord! that they enter the Gardens of Eternity, which Thouhast promised to them, and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives,and their posterity! For Thou art [He], the Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  "And preserve them from [all] ills; and any whom Thou dost preserve from illsthat Day,- on them wilt Thou have bestowed Mercy indeed: and that will be truly[for them] the highest Achievement". </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  The Unbelievers will be addressed: "Greater was the aversion of Allah to youthan [is] your aversion to yourselves, seeing that ye were called to the Faithand ye used to refuse." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  They will say: "Our Lord! twice hast Thou made us without life, and twicehast Thou given us Life! Now have we recognised our sins: Is there any way out[of this]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  [The answer will be:] "This is because, when Allah was invoked as the Only[object of worship], ye did reject Faith, but when partners were joined to Him,ye believed! the Command is with Allah, Most High, Most Great!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  He it is Who showeth you his Signs, and sendeth down sustenance for you fromthe sky: but only those receive admonition who turn [to Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Call ye, then, upon Allah with sincere devotion to Him, even though theUnbelievers may detest it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Raised high above ranks [or degrees], [He is] the Lord of the Throne [ofAuthority]: by His Command doth He send the Spirit [of inspiration] to any ofHis servants he pleases, that it may warn [men] of the Day of Mutual Meeting,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  The Day whereon they will [all] come forth: not a single thing concerningthem is hidden from Allah. Whose will be the dominion that Day?" That of Allah,the One the Irresistible! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  That Day will every soul be requited for what it earned; no injustice willthere be that Day, for Allah is Swift in taking account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Warn them of the Day that is [ever] drawing near, when the hearts will[come] right up to the throats to choke [them]; No intimate friend norintercessor will the wrong-doers have, who could be listened to. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  [Allah] knows of [the tricks] that deceive with the eyes, and all that thehearts [of men] conceal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And Allah will judge with [justice and] Truth: but those whom [men] invokebesides Him, will not [be in a position] to judge at all. Verily it is Allah[alone] Who hears and sees [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of thosebefore them? They were even superior to them in strength, and in the traces[they have left] in the land: but Allah did call them to account for their sins,and none had they to defend them against Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  That was because there came to them their messengers with Clear [Signs], butthey rejected them: So Allah called them to account: for He is Full of Strength,Strict in Punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Of old We sent Moses, with Our Signs and an authority manifest, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  To Pharaoh, Haman, and Qarun; but they called [him]" a sorcerer tellinglies!"... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Now, when he came to them in Truth, from Us, they said, "Slay the sons ofthose who believe with him, and keep alive their females," but the plots ofUnbelievers [end] in nothing but errors [and delusions]!... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Said Pharaoh: "Leave me to slay Moses; and let him call on his Lord! What Ifear is lest he should change your religion, or lest he should cause mischief toappear in the land!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  Moses said: "I have indeed called upon my Lord and your Lord [forprotection] from every arrogant one who believes not in the Day of Account!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed hisfaith, said: "Will ye slay a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah'?- when hehas indeed come to you with Clear [Signs] from your Lord? and if he be a liar,on him is [the sin of] his lie: but, if he is telling the Truth, then will fallon you something of the [calamity] of which he warns you: Truly Allah guides notone who transgresses and lies! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "O my People! Yours is the dominion this day: Ye have the upper hand in theland: but who will help us from the Punishment of Allah, should it befall us?"Pharaoh said: "I but point out to you that which I see [myself]; Nor do I guideyou but to the Path of Right!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Then said the man who believed: "O my people! Truly I do fear for yousomething like the Day [of disaster] of the Confederates [in sin]!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  "Something like the fate of the People of Noah, the 'Ad, and the Thamud, andthose who came after them: but Allah never wishes injustice to his Servants. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  "And O my people! I fear for you a Day when there will be Mutual calling[and wailing],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  "A Day when ye shall turn your backs and flee: No defender shall ye havefrom Allah: Any whom Allah leaves to stray, there is none to guide.... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  "And to you there came Joseph in times gone by, with Clear Signs, but yeceased not to doubt of the [Mission] for which he had come: At length, when hedied, ye said: 'No messenger will Allah send after him.' thus doth Allah leaveto stray such as transgress and live in doubt,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  "[Such] as dispute about the Signs of Allah, without any authority that hathreached them, grievous and odious [is such conduct] in the sight of Allah and ofthe Believers. Thus doth Allah, seal up every heart - of arrogant and obstinateTransgressors." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Pharaoh said: "O Haman! Build me a lofty palace, that I may attain the waysand means-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  "The ways and means of [reaching] the heavens, and that I may mount up tothe god of Moses: But as far as I am concerned, I think [Moses] is a liar!" Thuswas made alluring, in Pharaoh's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hinderedfrom the Path; and the plot of Pharaoh led to nothing but perdition [for him]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  The man who believed said further: "O my people! Follow me: I will lead youto the Path of Right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  "O my people! This life of the present is nothing but [temporary]convenience: It is the Hereafter that is the Home that will last. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  "He that works evil will not be requited but by the like thereof: and hethat works a righteous deed - whether man or woman - and is a Believer- suchwill enter the Garden [of Bliss]: Therein will they have abundance withoutmeasure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  "And O my people! How [strange] it is for me to call you to Salvation whileye call me to the Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  "Ye do call upon me to blaspheme against Allah, and to join with Himpartners of whom I have no knowledge; and I call you to the Exalted in Power,Who forgives again and again!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  "Without doubt ye do call me to one who is not fit to be called to, whetherin this world, or in the Hereafter; our return will be to Allah; and theTransgressors will be Companions of the Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  "Soon will ye remember what I say to you [now], My [own] affair I commit toAllah: for Allah [ever] watches over His Servants." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Then Allah saved him from [every] ill that they plotted [against him], butthe burnt of the Penalty encompassed on all sides the People of Pharaoh. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  In front of the Fire will they be brought, morning and evening: And [thesentence will be] on the Day that Judgment will be established: "Cast ye thePeople of Pharaoh into the severest Penalty!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Behold, they will dispute with each other in the Fire! The weak ones [whofollowed] will say to those who had been arrogant, "We but followed you: Can yethen take [on yourselves] from us some share of the Fire? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  Those who had been arrogant will say: "We are all in this [Fire]! Truly,Allah has judged between [his] Servants!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Those in the Fire will say to the Keepers of Hell: "Pray to your Lord tolighten us the Penalty for a day [at least]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  They will say: "Did there not come to you your messengers with Clear Signs?"They will say, "Yes". They will reply, "Then pray [as ye like]! But the prayerof those without Faith is nothing but [futile wandering] in [mazes of] error!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  We will, without doubt, help our messengers and those who believe, [both] inthis world's life and on the Day when the Witnesses will stand forth,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  The Day when no profit will it be to Wrong-doers to present their excuses,but they will [only] have the Curse and the Home of Misery. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  We did aforetime give Moses the [Book of] Guidance, and We gave the book ininheritance to the Children of Israel,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  A Guide and a Message to men of Understanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  Patiently, then, persevere: for the Promise of Allah is true: and askforgiveness for thy fault, and celebrate the Praises of thy Lord in the eveningand in the morning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  Those who dispute about the signs of Allah without any authority bestowed onthem,- there is nothing in their breasts but [the quest of] greatness, whichthey shall never attain to: seek refuge, then, in Allah: It is He Who hears andsees [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater [matter]than the creation of men: Yet most men understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  Not equal are the blind and those who [clearly] see: Nor are [equal] thosewho believe and work deeds of righteousness, and those who do evil. Little do yelearn by admonition! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  The Hour will certainly come: Therein is no doubt: Yet most men believe not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  And your Lord says: "Call on Me; I will answer your [Prayer]: but those whoare too arrogant to serve Me will surely find themselves in Hell - inhumiliation!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  It is Allah Who has made the Night for you, that ye may rest therein, andthe days as that which helps [you] to see. Verily Allah is full of Grace andBounty to men: yet most men give no thanks. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He:Then how ye are deluded away from the Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  Thus are deluded those who are wont to reject the Signs of Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  It is Allah Who has made for you the earth as a resting place, and the skyas a canopy, and has given you shape- and made your shapes beautiful,- and hasprovided for you Sustenance, of things pure and good;- such is Allah your Lord.So Glory to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  He is the Living [One]: There is no god but He: Call upon Him, giving Himsincere devotion. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  Say: "I have been forbidden to invoke those whom ye invoke besides Allah,-seeing that the Clear Signs have come to me from my Lord; and I have beencommanded to bow [in Islam] to the Lord of the Worlds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  It is He Who has created you from dust then from a sperm-drop, then from aleech-like clot; then does he get you out [into the light] as a child: then letsyou [grow and] reach your age of full strength; then lets you become old,-though of you there are some who die before;- and lets you reach a Termappointed; in order that ye may learn wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  It is He Who gives Life and Death; and when He decides upon an affair, Hesays to it, "Be", and it is. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  Seest thou not those that dispute concerning the Signs of Allah? How arethey turned away [from Reality]?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  Those who reject the Book and the [revelations] with which We sent ourmessengers: but soon shall they know,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  When the yokes [shall be] round their necks, and the chains; they shall bedragged along-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  In the boiling fetid fluid: then in the Fire shall they be burned; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  Then shall it be said to them: "Where are the [deities] to which ye gavepart-worship-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  "In derogation of Allah?" They will reply: "They have left us in the lurch:Nay, we invoked not, of old, anything [that had real existence]." Thus doesAllah leave the Unbelievers to stray. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  "That was because ye were wont to rejoice on the earth in things other thanthe Truth, and that ye were wont to be insolent. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  "Enter ye the gates of Hell, to dwell therein: and evil is [this] abode ofthe arrogant!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  So persevere in patience; for the Promise of Allah is true: and whether Weshow thee [in this life] some part of what We promise them,- or We take thy soul[to Our Mercy] [before that],-[in any case] it is to Us that they shall [all]return. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whosestory We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee.It was not [possible] for any messenger to bring a sign except by the leave ofAllah: but when the Command of Allah issued, the matter was decided in truth andjustice, and there perished, there and then those who stood on Falsehoods. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  It is Allah Who made cattle for you, that ye may use some for riding andsome for food; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  And there are [other] advantages in them for you [besides]; that ye maythrough them attain to any need [there may be] in your hearts; and on them andon ships ye are carried. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  And He shows you [always] His Signs: then which of the Signs of Allah willye deny? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of thosebefore them? They were more numerous than these and superior in strength and inthe traces [they have left] in the land: Yet all that they accomplished was ofno profit to them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  For when their messengers came to them with Clear Signs, they exulted insuch knowledge [and skill] as they had; but that very [Wrath] at which they werewont to scoff hemmed them in. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  But when they saw Our Punishment, they said: "We believe in Allah,- the oneAllah - and we reject the partners we used to join with Him." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  But their professing the Faith when they [actually] saw Our Punishment wasnot going to profit them. [Such has been] Allah's Way of dealing with HisServants [from the most ancient times]. And even thus did the Rejecters of Allahperish [utterly]! </p>
