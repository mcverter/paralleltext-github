<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Were We then weary with the first Creation, that they should be in confuseddoubt about a new Creation? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  It was We Who created man, and We know what dark suggestions his soul makesto him: for We are nearer to him than [his] jugular vein. </p>
