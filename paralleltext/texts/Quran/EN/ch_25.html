<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 25. Furqan, or The Criterion </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Blessed is He who sent down the criterion to His servant, that it may be anadmonition to all creatures;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: no son has Hebegotten, nor has He a partner in His dominion: it is He who created all things,and ordered them in due proportions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Yet have they taken, besides him, gods that can create nothing but arethemselves created; that have no control of hurt or good to themselves; nor canthey control death nor life nor resurrection. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  But the misbelievers say: "Naught is this but a lie which he has forged, andothers have helped him at it." In truth it is they who have put forward aniniquity and a falsehood. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And they say: "Tales of the ancients, which he has caused to be written: andthey are dictated before him morning and evening." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Say: "The [Qur'an] was sent down by Him who knows the mystery [that is] inthe heavens and the earth: verily He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  And they say: "What sort of a messenger is this, who eats food, and walksthrough the streets? Why has not an angel been sent down to him to giveadmonition with him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  "Or [Why] has not a treasure been bestowed on him, or why has he [not] agarden for enjoyment?" The wicked say: "Ye follow none other than a manbewitched." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  See what kinds of comparisons they make for thee! But they have gone astray,and never a way will they be able to find! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Blessed is He who, if that were His will, could give thee better [things]than those,- Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and He could give thee palaces[secure to dwell in]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Nay they deny the hour [of the judgment to come]: but We have prepared ablazing fire for such as deny the hour: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  When it sees them from a place far off, they will hear its fury and itsranging sigh. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And when they are cast, bound together into a constricted place therein,they will plead for destruction there and then! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  "This day plead not for a single destruction: plead for destruction oft-repeated!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Say: "Is that best, or the eternal garden, promised to the righteous? forthem, that is a reward as well as a goal [of attainment]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  "For them there will be therein all that they wish for: they will dwell[there] for aye: A promise to be prayed for from thy Lord." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  The day He will gather them together as well as those whom they worshipbesides Allah, He will ask: "Was it ye who let these My servants astray, or didthey stray from the Path themselves?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  They will say: "Glory to Thee! not meet was it for us that we should takefor protectors others besides Thee: But Thou didst bestow, on them and theirfathers, good things [in life], until they forgot the Message: for they were apeople [worthless and] lost." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  [Allah will say]: "Now have they proved you liars in what ye say: so yecannot avert [your penalty] nor [get] help." And whoever among you does wrong,him shall We cause to taste of a grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And the messengers whom We sent before thee were all [men] who ate food andwalked through the streets: We have made some of you as a trial for others: willye have patience? for Allah is One Who sees [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Such as fear not the meeting with Us [for Judgment] say: "Why are not theangels sent down to us, or [why] do we not see our Lord?" Indeed they have anarrogant conceit of themselves, and mighty is the insolence of their impiety! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  The Day they see the angels,- no joy will there be to the sinners that Day:The [angels] will say: "There is a barrier forbidden [to you] altogether!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did [in this life], and We shallmake such deeds as floating dust scattered about. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  The Companions of the Garden will be well, that Day, in their abode, andhave the fairest of places for repose. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  The Day the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds, and angels shall besent down, descending [in ranks],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  That Day, the dominion as of right and truth, shall be [wholly] for [Allah]Most Merciful: it will be a Day of dire difficulty for the Misbelievers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  The Day that the wrong-doer will bite at his hands, he will say, "Oh! wouldthat I had taken a [straight] path with the Messenger! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  "Ah! woe is me! Would that I had never taken such a one for a friend! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "He did lead me astray from the Message [of Allah] after it had come to me!Ah! the Evil One is but a traitor to man!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Then the Messenger will say: "O my Lord! Truly my people took this Qur'anfor just foolish nonsense." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Thus have We made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners: but enoughis thy Lord to guide and to help. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Those who reject Faith say: "Why is not the Qur'an revealed to him all atonce? Thus [is it revealed], that We may strengthen thy heart thereby, and Wehave rehearsed it to thee in slow, well-arranged stages, gradually. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  And no question do they bring to thee but We reveal to thee the truth andthe best explanation [thereof]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Those who will be gathered to Hell [prone] on their faces,- they will be inan evil plight, and, as to Path, most astray. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  [Before this,] We sent Moses The Book, and appointed his brother Aaron withhim as minister; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  And We command: "Go ye both, to the people who have rejected our Signs:" Andthose [people] We destroyed with utter destruction. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  And the people of Noah,- when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them,and We made them as a Sign for mankind; and We have prepared for [all] wrong­doers a grievous Penalty;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  As also 'Ad and Thamud, and the Companions of the Rass, and many ageneration between them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  To each one We set forth Parables and examples; and each one We broke toutter annihilation [for their sins]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  And the [Unbelievers] must indeed have passed by the town on which wasrained a shower of evil: did they not then see it [with their own eyes]? Butthey fear not the Resurrection. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  When they see thee, they treat thee no otherwise than in mockery: "Is thisthe one whom Allah has sent as a messenger?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  "He indeed would well-nigh have misled us from our gods, had it not beenthat we were constant to them!" - Soon will they know, when they see thePenalty, who it is that is most misled in Path! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own passion [or impulse]?Couldst thou be a disposer of affairs for him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Or thinkest thou that most of them listen or understand? They are only likecattle;- nay, they are worse astray in Path. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Hast thou not turned thy vision to thy Lord?- How He doth prolong theshadow! If He willed, He could make it stationary! then do We make the sun itsguide; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Then We draw it in towards Ourselves,- a contraction by easy stages. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  And He it is Who makes the Night as a Robe for you, and Sleep as Repose, andmakes the Day [as it were] a Resurrection. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  And He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going beforeHis mercy, and We send down pure water from the sky,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of thingsWe have created,- cattle and men in great numbers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  And We have distributed the [water] amongst them, in order that they maycelebrate [our] praises, but most men are averse [to aught] but [rank]ingratitude. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  Had it been Our Will, We could have sent a warner to every centre ofpopulation. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with theutmost strenuousness, with the [Qur'an]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water: One palatable andsweet, and the other salt and bitter; yet has He made a barrier between them, apartition that is forbidden to be passed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  It is He Who has created man from water: then has He established relationships of lineage and marriage: for thy Lord has power [over all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  Yet do they worship, besides Allah, things that can neither profit them norharm them: and the Misbeliever is a helper [of Evil], against his own Lord! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and admonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  Say: "No reward do I ask of you for it but this: that each one who will maytake a [straight] Path to his Lord." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not; and celebrate his praise;and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between, in sixdays, and is firmly established on the Throne [of Authority]: Allah MostGracious: ask thou, then, about Him of any acquainted [with such things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  When it is said to them, "Prostrate to [Allah] Most Gracious!", they say,"And what is [Allah] Most Gracious? Shall we prostrate to that which thoucommandest us?" And it increases their flight [from the Truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein aLamp and a Moon giving light; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  And it is He Who made the Night and the Day to follow each other: for suchas have the will to celebrate His praises or to show their gratitude. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  And the servants of [Allah] Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth inhumility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace!"; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  Those who spend the night in adoration of their Lord prostrate and standing; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  Those who say, "Our Lord! avert from us the Wrath of Hell, for its Wrath isindeed an affliction grievous,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  "Evil indeed is it as an abode, and as a place to rest in"; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  Those who, when they spend, are not extravagant and not niggardly, but holda just [balance] between those [extremes]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, nor slay such life as Allahhas made sacred except for just cause, nor commit fornication; - and any thatdoes this [not only] meets punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  [But] the Penalty on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him, and he willdwell therein in ignominy,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  Unless he repents, believes, and works righteous deeds, for Allah willchange the evil of such persons into good, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, MostMerciful, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah with an[acceptable] conversion;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  Those who witness no falsehood, and, if they pass by futility, they pass byit with honourable [avoidance]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  Those who, when they are admonished with the Signs of their Lord, droop notdown at them as if they were deaf or blind; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  And those who pray, "Our Lord! Grant unto us wives and offspring who will bethe comfort of our eyes, and give us [the grace] to lead the righteous." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  Those are the ones who will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven,because of their patient constancy: therein shall they be met with salutationsand peace, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  Dwelling therein;- how beautiful an abode and place of rest! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  Say [to the Rejecters]: "My Lord is not uneasy because of you if ye call noton Him: But ye have indeed rejected [Him], and soon will come the inevitable[punishment]!" </p>
