<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 44. Dukhan, or Smoke (or Mist) </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Ha-Mim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  By the Book that makes things clear;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  We sent it down during a Blessed Night: for We [ever] wish to warn [againstEvil]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  In the [Night] is made distinct every affair of wisdom, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  By command, from Our Presence. For We [ever] send [revelations], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  As Mercy from thy Lord: for He hears and knows [all things]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all between them, if ye [but] havean assured faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  There is no god but He: It is He Who gives life and gives death,- The Lordand Cherisher to you and your earliest ancestors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Yet they play about in doubt. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Then watch thou for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke[or mist] plainly visible, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Enveloping the people: this will be a Penalty Grievous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  [They will say:] "Our Lord! remove the Penalty from us, for we do reallybelieve!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  How shall the message be [effectual] for them, seeing that an Messengerexplaining things clearly has [already] come to them,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Yet they turn away from him and say: "Tutored [by others], a man possessed!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  We shall indeed remove the Penalty for a while, [but] truly ye will revert[to your ways]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  One day We shall seize you with a mighty onslaught: We will indeed [then]exact Retribution! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  We did, before them, try the people of Pharaoh: there came to them amessenger most honourable, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Saying: "Restore to me the Servants of Allah: I am to you an messengerworthy of all trust; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  "And be not arrogant as against Allah: for I come to you with authoritymanifest. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  "For me, I have sought safety with my Lord and your Lord, against yourinjuring me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  "If ye believe me not, at least keep yourselves away from me." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  [But they were aggressive:] then he cried to his Lord: "These are indeed apeople given to sin." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  [The reply came:] "March forth with My Servants by night: for ye are sure tobe pursued. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  "And leave the sea as a furrow [divided]: for they are a host [destined] tobe drowned." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  How many were the gardens and springs they left behind, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And corn-fields and noble buildings, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And wealth [and conveniences of life], wherein they had taken such delight! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Thus [was their end]! And We made other people inherit [those things]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  And neither heaven nor earth shed a tear over them: nor were they given arespite [again]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  We did deliver aforetime the Children of Israel from humiliating Punishment, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Inflicted by Pharaoh, for he was arrogant [even] among inordinatetransgressors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And We chose them aforetime above the nations, knowingly, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  And granted them Signs in which there was a manifest trial </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  As to these [Quraish], they say forsooth: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  "There is nothing beyond our first death, and we shall not be raised again. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  "Then bring [back] our forefathers, if what ye say is true!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  What! Are they better than the people of Tubba and those who were beforethem? We destroyed them because they were guilty of sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, merely in[idle] sport: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  We created them not except for just ends: but most of them do notunderstand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Verily the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  The Day when no protector can avail his client in aught, and no help canthey receive, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Except such as receive Allah's Mercy: for He is Exalted in Might, MostMerciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  Verily the tree of Zaqqum </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Will be the food of the Sinful,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Like molten brass; it will boil in their insides. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Like the boiling of scalding water. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  [A voice will cry: "Seize ye him and drag him into the midst of the BlazingFire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  "Then pour over his head the Penalty of Boiling Water, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  "Taste thou [this]! Truly wast thou mighty, full of honour! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  "Truly this is what ye used to doubt!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  As to the Righteous [they will be] in a position of Security, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  Among Gardens and Springs; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  Dressed in fine silk and in rich brocade, they will face each other; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  So; and We shall join them to fair women with beautiful, big, and lustrouseyes. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  There can they call for every kind of fruit in peace and security; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  Nor will they there taste Death, except the first death; and He willpreserve them from the Penalty of the Blazing Fire,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  As a Bounty from thy Lord! that will be the supreme achievement! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  Verily, We have made this [Qur'an] easy, in thy tongue, in order that theymay give heed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  So wait thou and watch; for they [too] are waiting. </p>
