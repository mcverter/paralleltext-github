<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 5. Maida, or the Table Spread </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  O ye who believe! Fulfill (all) obligations. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Lawful unto you (for food) are all four-footed animals with the exceptionsnamed: But animals of the chase are forbidden while ye are in the SacredPrecincts or in pilgrim garb: For Allah doth command according to His Will andPlan. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  O ye who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the Symbols of Allah, nor ofthe Sacred Month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlandsthat mark out such animals, nor the people resorting to the Sacred House,seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when ye are clear ofthe Sacred Precincts and of pilgrim garb, ye may hunt and let not the hatred ofsome people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you totransgression (and hostility on your part). Help ye one another in righteousnessand piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancor: Fear Allah: For Allahis strict in punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Forbidden to you (for food) are: Dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, andthat on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah; that which hathbeen killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or bybeing gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal;unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed onstone (alters); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling witharrows: That is impiety. This day have those who reject Faith given up all hopeof your religion: Yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected yourreligion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam asyour religion. But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination totransgression, Allah is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  They ask thee what is lawful to them (as food). Say: Lawful unto you are(all) things good and pure and what ye have taught your trained hunting animals(to catch) in the manner directed to you by Allah: Eat what they catch for you,but pronounce the name of Allah over it: And fear Allah; for Allah is swift intaking account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of thePeople of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawfulunto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chastewomen among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, -- when ye givethem their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues.If any one rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will bein the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  O ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands(and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet tothe ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body.But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature,or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take foryourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. Allahdoth not wish to place you in a difficulty, but to make you clean, and tocomplete His favor to you, that ye may be grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  And call in remembrance the favor of Allah unto you, and his Covenant, whichhe ratified with you, when ye said: "We hear and we obey": And fear Allah, forAllah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  O ye who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah, as witnesses to fair dealing,and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">justice. Be just: That is next to Piety: And fear Allah. For Allah is wellacquainted with all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">10.  To those who believe and do deeds of righteousness hath Allah promisedforgiveness and a great reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">11.  Those who reject faith and deny Our Signs will be Companions of Hellfire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">12.  O ye who believe! Call in remembrance the favor of Allah unto you whencertain men formed the design to stretch out their hands against you, but(Allah) held back their hands from you: So fear Allah. And on Allah letBelievers put (all) their trust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">13.  Allah did aforetime take a Covenant from the Children of Israel, and Weappointed twelve captains among them. And Allah said: "I am with you: If ye(but) establish regular Prayers, practice regular Charity, believe in Myapostles, honor and assist them, and loan to Allah a beautiful loan, verily Iwill wipe out from you your evils, and admit you to Gardens with rivers flowingbeneath; but if any of you, after this, resisteth faith, he hath truly wanderedfrom the path of rectitude." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">14.  But because of their breach of their Covenant, We cursed them, and madetheir hearts grow hard: They change the words from their (right) places andforget a good part of the Message that was sent them, nor wilt thou cease tofind them--barring a few--ever bent on (new) deceits: But forgive them, andoverlook (their misdeeds): For Allah loveth those who are kind. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">15.  From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a Covenant, butthey forgot a good part of the Message that was sent them: So We estranged them,with enmity and hatred between one and the other, to the Day of Judgment. Andsoon will Allah show them what it is they have done. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">16.  O People of the Book! There hath come to you our Apostle, revealing to youmuch that ye used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is nowunnecessary): </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">17.  There hath come to you from Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book, --</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">18.  Wherewith Allah guideth all who seek His good pleasure to ways of peace andsafety, and leadeth them out of darkness, by His Will, unto the light, --guideth them to a Path that is Straight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">19.  In blasphemy indeed are those that say that Allah is Christ the son of Mary.Say "Who then hath the least power against Allah, if His Will were to destroyChrist the son of Mary, his mother, and all--every one that is on the earth? Forto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that isbetween. He createth what He pleaseth. For Allah hath power over all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">20.  (Both) the Jews and the Christians say: "We are the sons of Allah, and Hisbeloved." Say: "Why then doth He punish you for your sins? Nay, ye are but men,--of the men He hath created: He forgiveth whom He pleaseth. And He punishethwhom He pleaseth: And to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and theearth, and all that is between: And unto Him is the final goal (of all)." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">21.  O People of the Book! Now hath come unto you, making (things) clear untoyou, our Apostle, after the break in (the series of) our apostles, lest yeshould say: "There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner (fromevil)": But now hath come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner (fromevil). And Allah hath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">22.  Remember Moses said to his people: "O my People! Call in remembrance thefavor of Allah unto you, when He produced prophets among you, made you kings,and gave you what He had not given to any other among the peoples." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">23.  "O my People! Enter the holy land which Allah hath assigned unto you, andturn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">24.  They said: "O Moses! In this land are a people of exceeding strength: Nevershall we enter it until they leave it: If (once) they leave, then shall weenter." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">25.  (But) among (their) Allah-fearing men were two on whom Allah had bestowedHis grace: They said: "Assault them at the (proper) Gate: When once ye are in,victory will be yours; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">26.  But on Allah put your trust if ye have faith." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">27.  They said: "O Moses! While they remain there, never shall we be able toenter, to the end of time. Go thou, and thy Lord, and fight ye two, while we sithere (and watch)." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">28.  He said: "O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother: Soseparate us from this rebellious people!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">29.  Allah said: "Therefore will the land be out of their reach for forty years:In distraction will they wander through the land: But sorrow thou not over theserebellious people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">30.  Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! Theyeach presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not fromthe other. Said the latter: "Be sure I will slay thee." "Surely," Said theformer, "Allah doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">31.  "If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me tostretch my hand against thee to slay thee: For I do fear Allah, the Cherisher ofthe Worlds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">32.  "For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, forthou wilt be among the Companions of the Fire, and that is the reward of thosewho do wrong." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">33.  The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: Hemurdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">34.  Then Allah sent a raven, who scratched the ground, to show him how to hidethe shame of his brother. "Woe is me!" said he; "Was I not even able to be asthis raven, and to hide the shame of my brother?" Then he became full ofregrets--</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">35.  On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slewa person--unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land- -itwould be as if he slew the whole people: And if any one saved a life, it wouldbe as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to themOur Apostles with Clear Signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued tocommit excesses in the land. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">36.  The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Apostle, andstrive with might and main for mischief through the land is: Execution, orcrucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exilefrom the land: That is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment istheirs in the Hereafter; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">37.  Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: In that case,know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">38.  O ye who believe! Do your duty to Allah, seek the means of approach untoHim, and strive with might and main in His cause: That ye may prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">39.  As to those who reject Faith, --if they had everything on earth, and twicerepeated, to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment, it wouldnever be accepted of them. Theirs would be a grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">40.  Their wish will be to get out of the Fire, but never will they get outtherefrom: Their Penalty will be one that endures. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">41.  As to the thief. Male or female, cut off his or her hands: A punishment byway of example, from Allah, for their crime: And Allah is Exalted in Power. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">42.  But if the thief repent after his crime, and amend his conduct, Allahturneth to him in forgiveness; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">43.  Knowest thou not that to Allah (alone) belongeth the dominion of the heavensand the earth? He punisheth whom He pleaseth, and He forgiveth whom He pleaseth:And Allah hath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">44.  O Apostle! Let not those grieve thee, who race each other into Unbelief:(Whether it be) among those who say "We believe" with their lips but whosehearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews, --men who will listen to any lie,--will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They changethe words from their (right) times and places: They say, "If ye are given this,take it, but if not, beware!" If any one's trial is intended by Allah, thou hastno authority in the least for him against Allah. For such--it is not Allah'swill to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and inthe Hereafter a heavy punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">45.  (They are fond of) listening to falsehood, of devouring anything forbidden.If they do come to thee, either judge between them, or decline to interfere. Ifthou decline, they cannot hurt thee in the least. If thou judge, judge in equitybetween them. For Allah loveth those who judge in equity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">46.  But why do they come to thee for decision, when they have (their own) lawbefore them? --Therein is the (plain) command of Allah; yet even after that,they would turn away. For they are not (really) People of Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">47.  It was We who revealed the Law (to Moses): Therein was guidance and light.By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the Prophets who bowed (as inIslam) to Allah's Will, by the Rabbis and the Doctors of Law: For to them wasentrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses thereto:Therefore fear not men, but fear Me, and sell not My signs for a miserableprice. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, theyare (no better than) Unbelievers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">48.  We ordained therein for them: "Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose,ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal." But if any one remitsthe retaliation by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for himself. And ifany fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (nobetter than) wrongdoers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">49.  And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Lawthat had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: Therein was guidance andlight, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: A guidance and anadmonition to those who fear Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">50.  Let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. Ifany do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (nobetter than) those who rebel. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">51.  To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that camebefore it, and guarding it in safety: So judge between them by what Allah hathrevealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">come to thee. To each among you have We prescribed a Law and an Open way. IfAllah had so willed, he would have made you a single People, but (His Plan is)to test you in what He hath given you: So strive as in a race in all virtues.The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of thematters in which ye dispute; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">52.  And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed,and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile theefrom any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turnaway, be assured that for some of their crimes it is Allah's purpose to punishthem. And truly most men are rebellious. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">53.  Do they then seek after a judgment of (the Days of) Ignorance? But who, fora people whose faith is assured, can give better judgment than Allah? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">54.  O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends andprotectors: They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongstyou that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah guideth not apeople unjust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">55.  Those in whose hearts is a disease--thou seest how eagerly they run aboutamongst them, saying: "We do fear lest a change of fortune bring us disaster."Ah! Perhaps Allah will give (thee) victory, or a decision according to His Will.Then will they repent of the thoughts, which they secretly harbored in theirhearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">56.  And those who believe will say: "Are these the men who swore their strongestoaths by Allah, that they were with you?" All that they do will be in vain, andthey will fall into (nothing but) ruin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">57.  O ye who believe! If any from among you turn back from his Faith, soon willAllah produce a people whom He will love as they will love Him, --Lowly with theBelievers, Mighty against the Rejecters, Fighting in the Way of Allah, and neverafraid of the reproaches of such as find fault. That is the Grace of Allah,which He will bestow on whom He pleaseth. And Allah encompasseth all, and Heknoweth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">58.  Your (real) friends are (no less than) Allah, His Apostle, and the(Fellowship of) Believers, --those who establish regular prayers and regularcharity, and they bow down humbly (in worship). </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">59.  As to those who turn (for friendship) to Allah, His Apostle, and the(Fellowship of) Believers, --it is the Fellowship of Allah that must certainlytriumph. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">60.  O ye who believe! Take not for friends and protectors those who take yourreligion for a mockery or sport, --whether among those who received theScripture before you, or among those who reject Faith; but fear ye Allah, if yehave Faith (indeed). </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">61.  When ye proclaim your call to prayer, they take it (but) as mockery andsport; that is because they are a people without understanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">62.  Say: "O People of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason thanthat we believe in Allah, and the revelation that hath come to us and that whichcame before (us), and (perhaps) that most of you are rebellious anddisobedient?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">63.  Say: "Shall I point out to you something much worse than this, (as judged)by the treatment it received from Allah? Those who incurred the curse of Allahand His wrath, those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">worshipped Evil; --these are (many times) worse in rank, and far more astrayfrom the even Path!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">64.  When they come to thee, they say: "We believe": But in fact they enter witha mind against Faith, and they go out with the same. But Allah knoweth fully allthat they hide. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">65.  Many of them dost thou see, racing each other in sin and rancor, and theireating of things forbidden. Evil indeed are the things that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">66.  Why do not the Rabbis and the doctors of law forbid them from their (habitof) uttering sinful words and eating things forbidden? Evil indeed are theirworks. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">67.  The Jews say: "Allah's hand is tied up." Be their hands tied up and be theyaccursed for the (blasphemy) they utter. Nay, both His hands are widelyoutstretched: He giveth and spendeth (of His bounty) as He pleaseth. But therevelation that cometh to thee from Allah increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. Amongst them We have placed enmity and hatredtill the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah dothextinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah lovethnot those who do mischief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">68.  If only the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, We shouldindeed have blotted out their iniquities and admitted them to Gardens of Bliss. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">69.  If only they had stood fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelationthat was sent to them from their Lord, they would have enjoyed happiness fromevery side. There is from among them a party on the right course: But many ofthem follow a course that is evil. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">70.  O Apostle! Proclaim the (Message) which hath been sent to thee from thyLord. If thou didst not, thou wouldst not have fulfilled His Mission. And Allahwill defend thee from men (who mean mischief). For Allah guideth not those whoreject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">71.  Say: "O People of the Book! Ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye standfast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you fromyour Lord." It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord, thatincreaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But sorrowthou not over (these) people without Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">72.  Those who believe (in the Koran), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),and the Sabians and the Christians, --any who believe in Allah and the Last Day,and work righteousness, --on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">73.  We took the Covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them apostles. Everytime there came to them an apostle with what they themselves desired not--some(of these) they called impostors, and some they (go so far as to) slay. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">74.  They thought there would be no trial (or punishment); so they became blindand deaf; yet Allah (in mercy) turned to them; yet again many of them becameblind and deaf. But Allah sees well all that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">75.  They do blaspheme who say: "Allah is Christ the son of Mary." But saidChrist: "O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord" Whoeverjoins other gods with Allah, --Allah will forbid him the Garden, and the Firewill be his abode. There will for the wrongdoers be no one to help. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">76.  They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: For there isno god except One God. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verilya grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">77.  Why turn they not to Allah, and seek His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">78.  Christ the son of Mary was no more than an Apostle; many were the apostlesthat passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They had both toeat their (daily) food. See how Allah doth make His Signs clear to them; yet seein what ways they are deluded away from the truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">79.  Say: "Will ye worship besides Allah, something which hath no power either toharm or benefit you? But Allah, --He it is that heareth and knoweth all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">80.  Say: "O People of the Book! Exceed not in your religion the bounds (of whatis proper), trespassing beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of peoplewho went wrong in times gone by, --who misled many, and strayed (themselves)from the even way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">81.  Curses were pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejectedFaith, by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary: Because theydisobeyed and persisted in excesses. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">82.  Nor did they (usually) forbid one another the iniquities which theycommitted: Evil indeed were the deeds which they did. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">83.  Thou seest many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers. Evilindeed are (the works) which their souls have sent forward before them (with theresult), that Allah's wrath is on them, and in torment will they abide. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">84.  If only they had believed in Allah, in the Apostle, and in what hath beenrevealed to him, never would they have taken them for friends and protectors,but most of them are rebellious wrongdoers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">85.  Strongest among men in enmity to the Believers wilt thou find the Jews andPagans; and nearest among them in love to the Believers wilt thou find those whosay, "We are Christians": Because amongst these are men devoted to learning andmen who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">86.  And when they listen to the revelation received by the Apostle, thou wiltsee their eyes overflowing with tears, for they recognize the truth: They pray:"Our Lord! We believe; write us down among the witnesses." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">87.  "What cause can we have not to believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us, seeing that we long for our Lord to admit us to the company of therighteous?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">88.  And for this their prayer hath Allah rewarded them with Gardens, with riversflowing underneath, --their eternal home. Such is the recompense of those who dogood. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">89.  But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, --they shall be Companionsof Hellfire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">90.  O ye who Believe! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah hath madelawful for you, but commit no excess: For Allah loveth not those given toexcess. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">91.  Eat of the things which Allah hath provided for you, lawful and good; butfear Allah, in Whom ye believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">92.  Allah will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths, but Hewill call you to account for your deliberate oaths: For expiation, feed tenindigent persons, on a scale of the average for the food of your families; orclothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means, fast forthree days. That is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn. But keep to youroaths. Thus doth Allah make clear to you His Signs, that ye may be grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">93.  O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and(divination by) arrows, are an abomination, --of Satan's handiwork: Eschew such(abomination), that ye may prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">94.  Satan's plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you, withintoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah, and fromprayer: Will ye not then abstain? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">95.  Obey Allah, and obey the Apostle, and beware (of evil): If ye do turn back,know ye that it is Our Apostle's duty to proclaim (the Message) in the clearestmanner. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">96.  On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness there is no blame forwhat they ate (in the past), when they guard themselves from evil, and believe,and do deeds of righteousness, --(or) again, guard themselves from evil andbelieve, --(or) again, guard themselves from evil and do good. For Allah loveththose who do good. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">97.  O ye who believe! Allah doth make a trial of you in a little matter of gamewell within reach of your hands and your lances, that He may test who fearethHim unseen: Any who transgress thereafter, will have a grievous penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">98.  O ye who believe! Kill not game while in the Sacred Precincts or in pilgrimgarb. If any of you doth so intentionally, the compensation is an offering,brought to the Kaba, of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed, asadjudged by two just men among you; or by way of atonement, the feeding of theindigent; or its equivalent in fasts: That he may taste of the penalty of hisdeed. Allah forgives what is past: For repetition Allah will exact from him thepenalty. For Allah is Exalted, and Lord of retribution. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">99.  Lawful to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food, --for thebenefit of yourselves and those who travel; but forbidden is the pursuit ofland-game; --as long as ye are in the Sacred Precincts or in pilgrim garb. Andfear Allah, to Whom ye shall be gathered back. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">100.  Allah made the Kaba, the Sacred House, as an asylum of security for men, asalso the Sacred Months, the animals for offerings, and the garlands that markthem: That ye may know that Allah hath knowledge of what is in the heavens andon earth and that Allah is well acquainted with all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">101.  Know ye that Allah is strict in punishment and that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">102.  The Apostle's duty is but to proclaim (the Message). But Allah knoweth allthat ye reveal and ye conceal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">103.  Say: "Not equal are things that are bad and things that are good, eventhough the abundance of the bad may, dazzle thee; so fear Allah, O ye thatunderstand; that (so) ye may prosper." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">104.  O ye who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made plain toyou, may cause you trouble. But if ye ask about things when the Koran is beingrevealed, they will be made plain to you, Allah will forgive those: For Allah isOft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">105.  Some people before you did ask such questions, and on that account losttheir faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">106.  It was not Allah who instituted (superstitions like those of) a slit- earshe-camel, or a she-camel let loose for free pasture, or idol sacrifices fortwin-births in animals, or stallion-camels freed from work: It is blasphemerswho invent a lie against Allah; but most of them lack wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">107.  When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah hath revealed; come to theApostle": They say: "Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following."What! Even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance? </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">109.  O ye who believe! When death approaches any of you, (take) witnesses amongyourselves when making bequests, --two just men of your own (brotherhood) orothers from outside if ye are journeying through the earth, and the chance ofdeath befalls you (thus). If ye doubt (their truth), detain them both afterprayer, and let them both swear by Allah: "We wish not in this for any worldlygain, even though the (beneficiary) be our near relation: We shall hide not theevidence before Allah: If we do, then behold! The sin be upon us!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">110.  But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of perjury),let two others stand forth in their places, --nearest in kin from among thosewho claim a lawful right: Let them swear by Allah: "We affirm that our witnessis truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed (beyond thetruth): If we did, Behold! The wrong be upon us!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">111.  That is most suitable: That they may give the evidence in its true natureand shape, or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after theiroaths. But fear Allah, and listen (to His counsel): For Allah guideth not arebellious people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">112.  One day will Allah gather the apostles together, and ask: "What was theresponse ye received (from men to your teaching)?" They will say: "We have noknowledge: It is Thou Who knowest in full all that is hidden." </p>

Thou makest out of clay, as it were, the figureof a bird, by My leave, and thou breathest into it, and it becometh a bird by Myleave, and thou healest those born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. Andbehold! Thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I did restrain theChildren of Israel from (violence to) thee when thou didst show them the ClearSigns, and the unbelievers among them said: 'This is nothing but evidentmagic'." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">114.  "And behold! I inspired the Disciples to have faith in Me and Mine Apostle:They said: 'We have faith, and do thou bear witness that we bow to Allah asMuslims'." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">115.  Behold! The Disciples said: "O Jesus the son of Mary! Can </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">thy Lord send down to us a Table set (with viands) from heaven?" Said Jesus:"Fear Allah, if ye have faith." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">116.  They said: "We only wish to eat thereof and satisfy our hearts, and to knowthat thou hast indeed told us the truth; and that we ourselves may be witnessesto the miracle." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="122">117.  Said Jesus the son of Mary: "O Allah our Lord! Send us from heaven a Tableset (with viands), that there may be for us--for the first and last of us--asolemn festival and a Sign from Thee; and provide for our sustenance, for Thouart the best Sustainer (of our needs)." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">118.  Allah said: "I will send it down unto you: But if any of you after thatresisteth faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflictedon any one among all the peoples." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">119.  And behold! Allah will say: "O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst say unto men,'Worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah'?" He will say: "Gloryto Thee! Never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such athing, Thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart,though I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that ishidden." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="125">120.  "Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say, towit, 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over themwhilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcherover them, and Thou art a witness to all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="126">121.  "If Thou dost punish them, they are Thy servants: If Thou dost forgivethem, Thou art the Exalted in power, the Wise." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="127">122.  Allah will say: "This is a day on which the truthful will profit from theirtruth: Theirs are the Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath, --their eternalhome": Allah well-pleased with them, and they with Allah: That is the greatSalvation, (the fulfillment of all desires). </p>
