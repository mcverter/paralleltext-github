<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 9. Tauba (Repentance) or Baraat (Immunity) </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  A [declaration] of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of thePagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, [as ye will],throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah [by yourfalsehood] but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people [assembled]on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve[treaty] obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you;but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim agrievous penalty to those who reject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  [But the treaties are] not dissolved with those Pagans with whom ye haveentered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, noraided any one against you. So fulfil your engagements with them to the end oftheir term: for Allah loveth the righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Paganswherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for themin every stratagem [of war]; but if they repent, and establish regular prayersand practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that hemay hear the word of Allah; and then escort him to where he can be secure. Thatis because they are men without knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  How can there be a league, before Allah and His Messenger, with the Pagans,except those with whom ye made a treaty near the sacred Mosque? As long as thesestand true to you, stand ye true to them: for Allah doth love the righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  How [can there be such a league], seeing that if they get an advantage overyou, they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant? With[fair words from] their mouths they entice you, but their hearts are averse fromyou; and most of them are rebellious and wicked. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  The Signs of Allah have they sold for a miserable price, and [many] have theyhindered from His way: evil indeed are the deeds they have done. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant! Itis they who have transgressed all bounds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  But [even so], if they repent, establish regular prayers, and practiseregular charity,- they are your brethren in Faith: [thus] do We explain theSigns in detail, for those who understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  But if they violate their oaths after their covenant, and taunt you for yourFaith,- fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith: for their oaths are nothing to them:that thus they may be restrained. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel theMessenger, and took the aggressive by being the first [to assault] you? Do yefear them? Nay, it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear, if ye believe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Fight them, and Allah will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame,help you [to victory] over them, heal the breasts of Believers, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  And still the indignation of their hearts. For Allah will turn [in mercy] towhom He will; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Or think ye that ye shall be abandoned, as though Allah did not know thoseamong you who strive with might and main, and take none for friends andprotectors except Allah, His Messenger, and the [community of] Believers? ButAllah is well-acquainted with [all] that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  It is not for such as join gods with Allah, to visit or maintain the mosquesof Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works ofsuch bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  The mosques of Allah shall be visited and maintained by such as believe inAllah and the Last Day, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity,and fear none [at all] except Allah. It is they who are expected to be on trueguidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the SacredMosque, equal to [the pious service of] those who believe in Allah and the Last </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">Day, and strive with might and main in the cause of Allah? They are notcomparable in the sight of Allah: and Allah guides not those who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">20.  Those who believe, and suffer exile and strive with might and main, inAllah's cause, with their goods and their persons, have the highest rank in thesight of Allah: they are the people who will achieve [salvation]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">21.  Their Lord doth give them glad tidings of a Mercy from Himself, of His goodpleasure, and of gardens for them, wherein are delights that endure: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">22.  They will dwell therein for ever. Verily in Allah's presence is a reward,the greatest [of all]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">23.  O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers ifthey love infidelity above Faith: if any of you do so, they do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">24.  Say: If it be that your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your mates, oryour kindred; the wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear adecline: or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than Allah, orHis Messenger, or the striving in His cause;- then wait until Allah brings aboutHis decision: and Allah guides not the rebellious. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">25.  Assuredly Allah did help you in many battle-fields and on the day of Hunain:Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the land,for all that it is wide, did constrain you, and ye turned back in retreat. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">26.  But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers, and sentdown forces which ye saw not: He punished the Unbelievers; thus doth He rewardthose without Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">27.  Again will Allah, after this, turn [in mercy] to whom He will: for Allah isOft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">28.  O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after thisyear of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon willAllah enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for Allah is All-knowing, All-wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">29.  Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold thatforbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledgethe religion of Truth, [even if they are] of the People of the Book, until theypay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">30.  The Jews call 'Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the sonof Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; [in this] they but imitate what theunbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are deludedaway from the Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">31.  They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogationof Allah, and [they take as their Lord] Christ the son of Mary; yet they werecommanded to worship but One Allah: there is no god but He. Praise and glory toHim: [Far is He] from having the partners they associate [with Him]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">32.  Fain would they extinguish Allah's light with their mouths, but Allah willnot allow but that His light should be perfected, even though the Unbelieversmay detest [it]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">33.  It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion ofTruth, to proclaim it over all religion, even though the Pagans may detest [it]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">34.  O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites,who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder [them] from the way ofAllah. And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the wayof Allah: announce unto them a most grievous penalty-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">35.  On the Day when heat will be produced out of that [wealth] in the fire ofHell, and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and theirbacks, their flanks, and their backs.- "This is the [treasure] which ye buriedfor yourselves: taste ye, then, the [treasures] ye buried!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">36.  The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve [in a year]- soordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four aresacred: that is the straight usage. So wrong not yourselves therein, and fightthe Pagans all together as they fight you all together. But know that Allah iswith those who restrain themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">37.  Verily the transposing [of a prohibited month] is an addition to Unbelief:the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year, andforbidden another year, in order to adjust the number of months forbidden byAllah and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their course seems pleasing to them. But Allah guideth not those who reject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">38.  O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to goforth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer thelife of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, ascompared with the Hereafter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">39.  Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and putothers in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hathpower over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">40.  If ye help not [your leader], [it is no matter]: for Allah did indeed helphim, when the Unbelievers drove him out: he had no more than one companion; theytwo were in the cave, and he said to his companion, "Have no fear, for Allah iswith us": then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him withforces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers.But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in might,Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">41.  Go ye forth, [whether equipped] lightly or heavily, and strive and struggle,with your goods and your persons, in the cause of Allah. That is best for you,if ye [but] knew. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">42.  If there had been immediate gain [in sight], and the journey easy, theywould [all] without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, [andweighed] on them. They would indeed swear by Allah, "If we only could, we shouldcertainly have come out with you": They would destroy their own souls; for Allahdoth know that they are certainly lying. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">43.  Allah give thee grace! why didst thou grant them until those who told thetruth were seen by thee in a clear light, and thou hadst proved the liars? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">44.  Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption fromfighting with their goods and persons. And Allah knoweth well those who do theirduty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">45.  Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in Allah and the Last Day,and whose hearts are in doubt, so that they are tossed in their doubts to andfro. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">46.  If they had intended to come out, they would certainly have made somepreparation therefor; but Allah was averse to their being sent forth; so He madethem lag behind, and they were told, "Sit ye among those who sit [inactive]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">47.  If they had come out with you, they would not have added to your [strength]but only [made for] disorder, hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">sedition among you, and there would have been some among you who would havelistened to them. But Allah knoweth well those who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">48.  Indeed they had plotted sedition before, and upset matters for thee, until,-the Truth arrived, and the Decree of Allah became manifest much to theirdisgust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">49.  Among them is [many] a man who says: "Grant me exemption and draw me notinto trial." Have they not fallen into trial already? and indeed Hell surroundsthe Unbelievers [on all sides]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">50.  If good befalls thee, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee,they say, "We took indeed our precautions beforehand," and they turn awayrejoicing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">51.  Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He isour protector": and on Allah let the Believers put their trust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">52.  Say: "Can you expect for us [any fate] other than one of two gloriousthings- [Martyrdom or victory]? But we can expect for you either that Allah willsend his punishment from Himself, or by our hands. So wait [expectant]; we toowill wait with you." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">53.  Say: "Spend [for the cause] willingly or unwillingly: not from you will itbe accepted: for ye are indeed a people rebellious and wicked." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">54.  The only reasons why their contributions are not accepted are: that theyreject Allah and His Messenger; that they come to prayer without earnestness;and that they offer contributions unwillingly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">55.  Let not their wealth nor their [following in] sons dazzle thee: in realityAllah's plan is to punish them with these things in this life, and that theirsouls may perish in their [very] denial of Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">56.  They swear by Allah that they are indeed of you; but they are not of you:yet they are afraid [to appear in their true colours]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">57.  If they could find a place to flee to, or caves, or a place of concealment,they would turn straightaway thereto, with an obstinate rush. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">58.  And among them are men who slander thee in the matter of [the distributionof] the alms: if they are given part thereof, they are pleased, but if not,behold! they are indignant! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">59.  If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger gave them,and had said, "Sufficient unto us is Allah! Allah and His Messenger will soongive us of His bounty: to Allah do we turn our hopes!" [that would have been theright course]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">60.  Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the[funds]; for those whose hearts have been [recently] reconciled [to Truth]; forthose in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: [thusis it] ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">61.  Among them are men who molest the Prophet and say, "He is [all] ear." Say,"He listens to what is best for you: he believes in Allah, has faith in theBelievers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe." But those who molest theMessenger will have a grievous penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">62.  To you they swear by Allah. In order to please you: But it is more fittingthat they should please Allah and His Messenger, if they are Believers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">63.  Know they not that for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, is the Fireof Hell?- wherein they shall dwell. That is the supreme disgrace. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">64.  The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down about them,showing them what is [really passing] in their hearts. Say: "Mock ye! But verilyAllah will bring to light all that ye fear [should be revealed]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">65.  If thou dost question them, they declare [with emphasis]: "We were onlytalking idly and in play." Say: "Was it at Allah, and His Signs, and HisMessenger, that ye were mocking?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">66.  Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If Wepardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for that they are in sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">67.  The Hypocrites, men and women, [have an understanding] with each other: Theyenjoin evil, and forbid what is just, and are close with their hands. They haveforgotten Allah; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebelliousand perverse. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">68.  Allah hath promised the Hypocrites men and women, and the rejecters, ofFaith, the fire of Hell: Therein shall they dwell: Sufficient is it for them:for them is the curse of Allah, and an enduring punishment,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">69.  As in the case of those before you: they were mightier than you in power,and more flourishing in wealth and children. They had their enjoyment of theirportion: and ye have of yours, as did those before you; and ye indulge in idletalk as they did. They!- their work are fruitless in this world and in theHereafter, and they will lose [all spiritual good]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">70.  Hath not the story reached them of those before them?- the People of Noah,and 'Ad, and Thamud; the People of Abraham, the men of Midian, and the citiesoverthrown. To them came their messengers with clear signs. It is not Allah Whowrongs them, but they wrong their own souls. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">71.  The Believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoinwhat is just, and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, practiseregular charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. On them will Allah pour Hismercy: for Allah is Exalted in power, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">72.  Allah hath promised to Believers, men and women, gardens under which riversflow, to dwell therein, and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss.But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah: that is the supremefelicity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">73.  O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and befirm against them. Their abode is Hell,- an evil refuge indeed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">74.  They swear by Allah that they said nothing [evil], but indeed they utteredblasphemy, and they did it after accepting Islam; and they meditated a plotwhich they were unable to carry out: this revenge of theirs was [their] onlyreturn for the bounty with which Allah and His Messenger had enriched them! Ifthey repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back [to their evilways], Allah will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in theHereafter: They shall have none on earth to protect or help them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">75.  Amongst them are men who made a covenant with Allah, that if He bestowed onthem of His bounty, they would give [largely] in charity, and be truly amongstthose who are righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">76.  But when He did bestow of His bounty, they became covetous, and turned back[from their covenant], averse [from its fulfilment]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">77.  So He hath put as a consequence hypocrisy into their hearts, [to last] tillthe Day, whereon they shall meet Him: because they broke their covenant withAllah, and because they lied [again and again]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">78.  Know they not that Allah doth know their secret [thoughts] and their secretcounsels, and that Allah knoweth well all things unseen? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">79.  Those who slander such of the believers as give themselves freely to [deedsof] charity, as well as such as can find nothing to give except the fruits oftheir labour,- and throw ridicule on them,- Allah will throw back their ridiculeon them: and they shall have a grievous penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">80.  Whether thou ask for their forgiveness, or not, [their sin is unforgivable]:if thou ask seventy times for their forgiveness, Allah will not forgive them:because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger: and Allah guideth not thosewho are perversely rebellious. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">81.  Those who were left behind [in the Tabuk expedition] rejoiced in theirinaction behind the back of the Messenger of Allah: they hated to strive andfight, with their goods and their persons, in the cause of Allah: they said, "Gonot forth in the heat." Say, "The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat." If only theycould understand! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">82.  Let them laugh a little: much will they weep: a recompense for the [evil]that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">83.  If, then, Allah bring thee back to any of them, and they ask thy permissionto come out [with thee], say: "Never shall ye come out with me, nor fight anenemy with me: for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion: Then sitye [now] with those who lag behind." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">84.  Nor do thou ever pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave; forthey rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died in a state of perverserebellion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">85.  Nor let their wealth nor their [following in] sons dazzle thee: Allah's planis to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls mayperish in their [very] denial of Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">86.  When a Sura comes down, enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive andfight along with His Messenger, those with wealth and influence among them askthee for exemption, and say: "Leave us [behind]: we would be with those who sit[at home]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">87.  They prefer to be with [the women], who remain behind [at home]: theirhearts are sealed and so they understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">88.  But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight withtheir wealth and their persons: for them are [all] good things: and it is theywho will prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">89.  Allah hath prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, to dwelltherein: that is the supreme felicity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">90.  And there were, among the desert Arabs [also], men who made excuses and cameto claim exemption; and those who were false to Allah and His Messenger [merely]sat inactive. Soon will a grievous penalty seize the Unbelievers among them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">91.  There is no blame on those who are infirm, or ill, or who find no resourcesto spend [on the cause], if they are sincere [in duty] to Allah and HisMessenger: no ground [of complaint] can there be against such as do right: andAllah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">92.  Nor [is there blame] on those who came to thee to be provided with mounts,and when thou saidst, "I can find no mounts for you," they turned back, theireyes streaming with tears of grief that they had no resources wherewith toprovide the expenses. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">93.  The ground [of complaint] is against such as claim exemption while they arerich. They prefer to stay with the [women] who remain behind: Allah hath sealedtheir hearts; so they know not [What they miss]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">94.  They will present their excuses to you when ye return to them. Say thou:"Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: Allah hath already informed us ofthe true state of matters concerning you: It is your actions that Allah and HisMessenger will observe: in the end will ye be brought back to Him Who knowethwhat is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that yedid." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">95.  They will swear to you by Allah, when ye return to them, that ye may leavethem alone. So leave them alone: For they are an abomination, and Hell is theirdwelling-place,-a fitting recompense for the [evil] that they did. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">96.  They will swear unto you, that ye may be pleased with them but if ye arepleased with them, Allah is not pleased with those who disobey. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">97.  The Arabs of the desert are the worst in Unbelief and hypocrisy, and mostfitted to be in ignorance of the command which Allah hath sent down to HisMessenger: But Allah is All-knowing, All-Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">98.  Some of the desert Arabs look upon their payments as a fine, and watch fordisasters for you: on them be the disaster of evil: for Allah is He That hearethand knoweth [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">99.  But some of the desert Arabs believe in Allah and the Last Day, and look ontheir payments as pious gifts bringing them nearer to Allah and obtaining theprayers of the Messenger. Aye, indeed they bring them nearer [to Him]: soon willAllah admit them to His Mercy: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">100.  The vanguard [of Islam]- the first of those who forsook [their homes] andof those who gave them aid, and [also] those who follow them in [all] gooddeeds,- well-pleased is Allah with them, as are they with Him: for them hath Heprepared gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever: that is thesupreme felicity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">101.  Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites, as well as[desert Arabs] among the Medina folk: they are obstinate in hypocrisy: thouknowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish them: and in additionshall they be sent to a grievous penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">102.  Others [there are who] have acknowledged their wrong-doings: they havemixed an act that was good with another that was evil. Perhaps Allah will turnunto them [in Mercy]: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">103.  Of their goods, take alms, that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them;and pray on their behalf. Verily thy prayers are a source of security for them:And Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">104.  Know they not that Allah doth accept repentance from His votaries andreceives their gifts of charity, and that Allah is verily He, the Oft-Returning,Most Merciful? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">105.  And say: "Work [righteousness]: Soon will Allah observe your work, and HisMessenger, and the Believers: Soon will ye be brought back to the knower of whatis hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">106.  There are [yet] others, held in suspense for the command of Allah, whetherHe will punish them, or turn in mercy to them: and Allah is All- Knowing, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">107.  And there are those who put up a mosque by way of mischief and infidelity -to disunite the Believers - and in preparation for one who warred against Allah </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">and His Messenger aforetime. They will indeed swear that their intention isnothing but good; But Allah doth declare that they are certainly liars. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">108.  Never stand thou forth therein. There is a mosque whose foundation was laidfrom the first day on piety; it is more worthy of the standing forth [forprayer] therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and Allah loveth thosewho make themselves pure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">109.  Which then is best? - he that layeth his foundation on piety to Allah andHis good pleasure? - or he that layeth his foundation on an undermined sand-cliff ready to crumble to pieces? and it doth crumble to pieces with him, intothe fire of Hell. And Allah guideth not people that do wrong. </p>
