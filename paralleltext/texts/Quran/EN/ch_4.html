<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 4. Nisaa, or The Woman </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  O mankind! reverence your Guardian-Lord, who created you from a singleperson, created, of like nature, His mate, and from them twain scattered [likeseeds] countless men and women;- reverence Allah, through whom ye demand yourmutual [rights], and [reverence] the wombs [That bore you]: for Allah everwatches over you. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  To orphans restore their property [When they reach their age], nor substitute[your] worthless things for [their] good ones; and devour not their substance[by mixing it up] with your won. For this is indeed a great sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marrywomen of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not beable to deal justly [with them], then only one, or [a captive] that your righthands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And give the women [on marriage] their dower as a free gift; but if they, oftheir own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, Take it and enjoy it withright good cheer. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  To those weak of understanding Make not over your property, which Allah hathmade a means of support for you, but feed and clothe them therewith, and speakto them words of kindness and justice. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye findsound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it notwastefully, nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off,Let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself whatis just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them, take witnessesin their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  From what is left by parents and those nearest related there is a share formen and a share for women, whether the property be small or large,-a determinateshare. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  But if at the time of division other relatives, or orphans or poor, arepresent, feed them out of the [property], and speak to them words of kindnessand justice. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Let those [disposing of an estate] have the same fear in their minds as theywould have for their own if they had left a helpless family behind: Let themfear Allah, and speak words of appropriate [comfort]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, eat up a Fire into theirown bodies: They will soon be enduring a Blazing Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Allah [thus] directs you as regards your Children's [Inheritance]: to themale, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, two or more,their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half.For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased leftchildren; if no children, and the parents are the [only] heirs, the mother has athird; if the deceased Left brothers [or sisters] the mother has a sixth. [Thedistribution in all cases ['s] after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye knownot whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. Theseare settled portions ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing, Al-wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  In what your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child; butif they leave a child, ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies and debts. Inwhat ye leave, their share is a fourth, if ye leave no child; but if ye leave achild, they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man orwoman whose inheritance is in question, has left neither ascendants nordescendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets asixth; but if more than two, they share in a third; after payment of legaciesand debts; so that no loss is caused [to any one]. Thus is it ordained by Allah;and Allah is All-knowing, Most Forbearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Those are limits set by Allah: those who obey Allah and His Messenger willbe admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein [for ever]and that will be the supreme achievement. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  But those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress His limits willbe admitted to a Fire, to abide therein: And they shall have a humiliatingpunishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, Take the evidence of four[Reliable] witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confinethem to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some [other]way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If theyrepent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Allah accept the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repentsoon afterwards; to them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full ofknowledge and wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil, until deathfaces one of them, and he says, "Now have I repented indeed;" nor of those whodie rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Norshould ye treat them with harshness, that ye may Take away part of the dower yehave given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on thecontrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take adislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and Allah brings aboutthrough it a great deal of good. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  But if ye decide to take one wife in place of another, even if ye had giventhe latter a whole treasure for dower, Take not the least bit of it back: Wouldye take it by slander and manifest wrong? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And how could ye take it when ye have gone in unto each other, and they haveTaken from you a solemn covenant? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  And marry not women whom your fathers married,- except what is past: It wasshameful and odious,- an abominable custom indeed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Prohibited to you [For marriage] are:- Your mothers, daughters, sisters;father's sisters, Mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters;foster-mothers [Who gave you suck], foster-sisters; your wives' mothers; yourstep-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom ye have gonein,- no prohibition if ye have not gone in;- [Those who have been] wives of yoursons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the sametime, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Also [prohibited are] women already married, except those whom your righthands possess: Thus hath Allah ordained [Prohibitions] against you: Except forthese, all others are lawful, provided ye seek [them in marriage] with giftsfrom your property,- desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefitfrom them, give them their dowers [at least] as prescribed; but if, after adower is prescribed, agree Mutually [to vary it], there is no blame on you, andAllah is All-knowing, All-wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  If any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, theymay wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess: AndAllah hath full knowledge about your faith. Ye are one from another: Wed themwith the leave of their owners, and give them their dowers, according to what isreasonable: They should be chaste, not lustful, nor taking paramours: when theyare taken in wedlock, if they fall into shame, their punishment is half that forfree women. This [permission] is for those among you who fear sin; but it isbetter for you that ye practise self- restraint. And Allah is Oft-forgiving,Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Allah doth wish to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of thosebefore you; and [He doth wish to] turn to you [In Mercy]: And Allah is All-knowing, All-wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  Allah doth wish to Turn to you, but the wish of those who follow their lustsis that ye should turn away [from Him],- far, far away. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Allah doth wish to lighten your [difficulties]: For man was created Weak [inflesh]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities: Butlet there be amongst you Traffic and trade by mutual good-will: Nor kill [ordestroy] yourselves: for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  If any do that in rancour and injustice,- soon shall We cast them into theFire: And easy it is for Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  If ye [but] eschew the most heinous of the things which ye are forbidden todo, We shall expel out of you all the evil in you, and admit you to a gate ofgreat honour. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And in no wise covet those things in which Allah Hath bestowed His giftsMore freely on some of you than on others: To men is allotted what they earn,and to women what they earn: But ask Allah of His bounty. For Allah hath fullknowledge of all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  To [benefit] every one, We have appointed shares and heirs to property leftby parents and relatives. To those, also, to whom your right hand was pledged,give their due portion. For truly Allah is witness to all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given theone more [strength] than the other, and because they support them from theirmeans. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in [thehusband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whosepart ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them [first], [Next], refuseto share their beds, [And last] beat them [lightly]; but if they return toobedience, seek not against them Means [of annoyance]: For Allah is Most High,great [above you all]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint [two] arbiters, one from hisfamily, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, Allah will cause theirreconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with allthings. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Serve Allah, and join not any partners with Him; and do good- to parents,kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbours who are near, neighbours who arestrangers, the companion by your side, the wayfarer [ye meet], and what yourright hands possess: For Allah loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  [Nor] those who are niggardly or enjoin niggardliness on others, or hide thebounties which Allah hath bestowed on them; for We have prepared, for those whoresist Faith, a punishment that steeps them in contempt;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Not those who spend of their substance, to be seen of men, but have no faithin Allah and the Last Day: If any take the Evil One for their intimate, what adreadful intimate he is! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  And what burden Were it on them if they had faith in Allah and in the LastDay, and they spent out of what Allah hath given them for sustenance? For Allahhath full knowledge of them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good [done], Hedoubleth it, and giveth from His own presence a great reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  How then if We brought from each people a witness, and We brought thee as awitness against these people! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  On that day those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger will wish thatthe earth Were made one with them: But never will they hide a single fact fromAllah! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye canunderstand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity [Except whentravelling on the road], until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, oron a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been incontact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand orearth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins andforgive again and again. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of theBook? they traffic in error, and wish that ye should lose the right path. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  But Allah hath full knowledge of your enemies: Allah is enough for aprotector, and Allah is enough for a Helper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their [right] places,and say: "We hear and we disobey"; and "Hear what is not Heard"; and "Ra'ina";with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said:"What hear and we obey"; and "Do hear"; and "Do look at us"; it would have been </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief;and but few of them will believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">47.  O ye People of the Book! believe in what We have [now] revealed, confirmingwhat was [already] with you, before We change the face and fame of some [of you]beyond all recognition, and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed theSabbath-breakers, for the decision of Allah Must be carried out. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">48.  Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but Heforgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah isto devise a sin Most heinous indeed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">49.  Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who claim sanctity for themselves?Nay-but Allah Doth sanctify whom He pleaseth. But never will they fail toreceive justice in the least little thing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">50.  Behold! how they invent a lie against Allah! but that by itself is amanifest sin! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">51.  Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of theBook? they believe in sorcery and Evil, and say to the Unbelievers that they arebetter guided in the [right] way Than the believers! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">52.  They are [men] whom Allah hath cursed: And those whom Allah Hath cursed,thou wilt find, have no one to help. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">53.  Have they a share in dominion or power? Behold, they give not a farthing totheir fellow-men? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">54.  Or do they envy mankind for what Allah hath given them of his bounty? but Wehad already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred uponthem a great kingdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">55.  Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him: Andenough is Hell for a burning fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">56.  Those who reject our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often astheir skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that theymay taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">57.  But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall soon admit toGardens, with rivers flowing beneath,- their eternal home: Therein shall theyhave companions pure and holy: We shall admit them to shades, cool and everdeepening. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">58.  Allah doth command you to render back your Trusts to those to whom they aredue; And when ye judge between man and man, that ye judge with justice: Verilyhow excellent is the teaching which He giveth you! For Allah is He Who hearethand seeth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">59.  O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those charged withauthority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it toAllah and His Messenger, if ye do believe in Allah and the Last Day: That isbest, and most suitable for final determination. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">60.  Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who declare that they believe inthe revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee? Their [real]wish is to resort together for judgment [in their disputes] to the Evil One,though they were ordered to reject him. But Satan's wish is to lead them astrayfar away [from the right]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">61.  When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah hath revealed, and to theMessenger": Thou seest the Hypocrites avert their faces from thee in disgust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">62.  How then, when they are seized by misfortune, because of the deeds whichthey hands have sent forth? Then their come to thee, swearing by Allah: "Wemeant no more than good-will and conciliation!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">63.  Those men,-Allah knows what is in their hearts; so keep clear of them, butadmonish them, and speak to them a word to reach their very souls. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">64.  We sent not a messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the will ofAllah. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come unto thee andasked Allah's forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them,they would have found Allah indeed Oft-returning, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">65.  But no, by the Lord, they can have no [real] Faith, until they make theejudge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistanceagainst Thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">66.  If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes,very few of them would have done it: But if they had done what they were[actually] told, it would have been best for them, and would have gone farthestto strengthen their [faith]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">67.  And We should then have given them from our presence a great reward; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">68.  And We should have shown them the Straight Way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">69.  All who obey Allah and the messenger are in the company of those on whom isthe Grace of Allah,- of the prophets [who teach], the sincere [lovers of Truth],the witnesses [who testify], and the Righteous [who do good]: Ah! what abeautiful fellowship! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">70.  Such is the bounty from Allah: And sufficient is it that Allah knoweth all. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">71.  O ye who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth in parties orgo forth all together. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">72.  There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortunebefalls you, they say: "Allah did favour us in that we were not present amongthem." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">73.  But if good fortune comes to you from Allah, they would be sure to say - asif there had never been Ties of affection between you and them - "Oh! I wish Ihad been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">74.  Let those fight in the cause of Allah Who sell the life of this world forthe hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah,- whether he is slainor gets victory - Soon shall We give him a reward of great [value]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">75.  And why should ye not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who, beingweak, are ill-treated [and oppressed]?- Men, women, and children, whose cry is:"Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise forus from thee one who will protect; and raise for us from thee one who willhelp!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">76.  Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject FaithFight in the cause of Evil: So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feebleindeed is the cunning of Satan. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">77.  Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back theirhands [from fight] but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity?When [at length] the order for fighting was issued to them, behold! a section ofthem feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah: Theysaid: "Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight? Wouldst Thou not Grant usrespite to our [natural] term, near [enough]?" Say: "Short is the enjoyment of </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye bedealt with unjustly in the very least! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">78.  "Wherever ye are, death will find you out, even if ye are in towers built upstrong and high!" If some good befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah"; butif evil, they say, "This is from thee" [O Prophet]. Say: "All things are fromAllah." But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand asingle fact? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">79.  Whatever good, [O man!] happens to thee, is from Allah; but whatever evilhappens to thee, is from thy [own] soul. and We have sent thee as a messenger to[instruct] mankind. And enough is Allah for a witness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">80.  He who obeys the Messenger, obeys Allah: But if any turn away, We have notsent thee to watch over their [evil deeds]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">81.  They have "Obedience" on their lips; but when they leave thee, a section ofthem Meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them.But Allah records their nightly [plots]: So keep clear of them, and put thytrust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">82.  Do they not consider the Qur'an [with care]? Had it been from other ThanAllah, they would surely have found therein Much discrepancy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">83.  When there comes to them some matter touching [Public] safety or fear, theydivulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger, or to those chargedwith authority among them, the proper investigators would have Tested it fromthem [direct]. Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allah unto you, all but afew of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">84.  Then fight in Allah's cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself -and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of theUnbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">85.  Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner therein: Andwhoever recommends and helps an evil cause, shares in its burden: And Allah hathpower over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">86.  When a [courteous] greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting stillmore courteous, or [at least] of equal courtesy. Allah takes careful account ofall things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">87.  Allah! There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you togetheragainst the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. And whose word canbe truer than Allah's? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">88.  Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hathupset them for their [evil] deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrownout of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shaltthou find the Way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">89.  They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on thesame footing [as they]: But take not friends from their ranks until they flee inthe way of Allah [From what is forbidden]. But if they turn renegades, seizethem and slay them wherever ye find them; and [in any case] take no friends orhelpers from their ranks;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">90.  Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty [ofpeace], or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting youas well as fighting their own people. If Allah had pleased, He could have giventhem power over you, and they would have fought you: Therefore if they withdrawfrom you but fight you not, and [instead] send you [Guarantees of] peace, thenAllah Hath opened no way for you [to war against them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">91.  Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that oftheir people: Every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto:if they withdraw not from you nor give you [guarantees] of peace besidesrestraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them: In theircase We have provided you with a clear argument against them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">92.  Never should a believer kill a believer; but [If it so happens] by mistake,[Compensation is due]: If one [so] kills a believer, it is ordained that heshould free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the deceased's family,unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war withyou, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave [Is enough]. If hebelonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensationshould be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who findthis beyond their means, [is prescribed] a fast for two months running: by wayof repentance to Allah: for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">93.  If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abidetherein [For ever]: And the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him, and adreadful penalty is prepared for him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">94.  O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of Allah, investigatecarefully, and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: "Thou art none ofa believer!" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with Allah are profitsand spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before, till Allah conferredon you His favours: Therefore carefully investigate. For Allah is well aware ofall that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">95.  Not equal are those believers who sit [at home] and receive no hurt, andthose who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and theirpersons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight withtheir goods and persons than to those who sit [at home]. Unto all [in Faith]Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguishedabove those who sit [at home] by a special reward,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">96.  Ranks specially bestowed by Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. For Allah isOft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">97.  When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, theysay: "In what [plight] Were ye?" They reply: "Weak and oppressed Were we in theearth." They say: "Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to moveyourselves away [From evil]?" Such men will find their abode in Hell,- What anevil refuge! -</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">98.  Except those who are [really] weak and oppressed - men, women, and children</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">-who have no means in their power, nor [a guide-post] to their way.  99.  For these, there is hope that Allah will forgive: For Allah doth blot out[sins] and forgive again and again. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">100.  He who forsakes his home in the cause of Allah, finds in the earth Many arefuge, wide and spacious: Should he die as a refugee from home for Allah andHis Messenger, His reward becomes due and sure with Allah: And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">101.  When ye travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if ye shortenyour prayers, for fear the Unbelievers May attack you: For the Unbelievers areunto you open enemies. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">102.  When thou [O Messenger] art with them, and standest to lead them in prayer,Let one party of them stand up [in prayer] with thee, Taking their arms withthem: When they finish their prostrations, let them Take their position in therear. And let the other party come up which hath not yet prayed - and let them </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">pray with thee, Taking all precaution, and bearing arms: the Unbelievers wish,if ye were negligent of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a singlerush. But there is no blame on you if ye put away your arms because of theinconvenience of rain or because ye are ill; but take [every] precaution foryourselves. For the Unbelievers Allah hath prepared a humiliating punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">103.  When ye pass [Congregational] prayers, celebrate Allah's praises, standing,sitting down, or lying down on your sides; but when ye are free from danger, setup Regular Prayers: For such prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">104.  And slacken not in following up the enemy: If ye are suffering hardships,they are suffering similar hardships; but ye have Hope from Allah, while theyhave none. And Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">105.  We have sent down to thee the Book in truth, that thou mightest judgebetween men, as guided by Allah: so be not [used] as an advocate by those whobetray their trust; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">106.  But seek the forgiveness of Allah; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, MostMerciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">107.  Contend not on behalf of such as betray their own souls; for Allah lovethnot one given to perfidy and crime: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">108.  They may hide [Their crimes] from men, but they cannot hide [Them] fromAllah, seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night, in words thatHe cannot approve: And Allah Doth compass round all that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">109.  Ah! These are the sort of men on whose behalf ye may contend in this world;but who will contend with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Judgment, or whowill carry their affairs through? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">110.  If any one does evil or wrongs his own soul but afterwards seeks Allah'sforgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">111.  And if any one earns sin. he earns it against His own soul: for Allah isfull of knowledge and wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">112.  But if any one earns a fault or a sin and throws it on to one that isinnocent, He carries [on himself] [Both] a falsehood and a flagrant sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">113.  But for the Grace of Allah to thee and his Mercy, a party of them wouldcertainly have plotted to lead thee astray. But [in fact] they will only Leadtheir own souls astray, and to thee they can do no harm in the least. For Allahhath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou Knewest not[before]: And great is the Grace of Allah unto thee. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">114.  In most of their secret talks there is no good: But if one exhorts to adeed of charity or justice or conciliation between men, [Secrecy ispermissible]: To him who does this, seeking the good pleasure of Allah, We shallsoon give a reward of the highest [value]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">115.  If anyone contends with the Messenger even after guidance has been plainlyconveyed to him, and follows a path other than that becoming to men of Faith, Weshall leave him in the path he has chosen, and land him in Hell,- what an evilrefuge! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">116.  Allah forgiveth not [The sin of] joining other gods with Him; but Heforgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins than this: one who joins other gods withAllah, Hath strayed far, far away [from the right]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">117.  [The Pagans], leaving Him, call but upon female deities: They call but uponSatan the persistent rebel! </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">119.  "I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will orderthem to slit the ears of cattle, and to deface the [fair] nature created byAllah." Whoever, forsaking Allah, takes Satan for a friend, hath of a suretysuffered a loss that is manifest. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">120.  Satan makes them promises, and creates in them false desires; but Satanspromises are nothing but deception. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="125">121.  They [his dupes] will have their dwelling in Hell, and from it they willfind no way of escape. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="126">122.  But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness,- we shall soon admitthem to gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,-to dwell therein for ever. Allah'spromise is the truth, and whose word can be truer than Allah's? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="127">123.  Not your desires, nor those of the People of the Book [can prevail]:whoever works evil, will be requited accordingly. Nor will he find, besidesAllah, any protector or helper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="128">124.  If any do deeds of righteousness,- be they male or female - and have faith,they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="129">125.  Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah,does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did takeAbraham for a friend. </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="131">127.  They ask thy instruction concerning the women say: Allah doth instruct youabout them: And [remember] what hath been rehearsed unto you in the Book,concerning the orphans of women to whom ye give not the portions prescribed, andyet whom ye desire to marry, as also concerning the children who are weak andoppressed: that ye stand firm for justice to orphans. There is not a good deedwhich ye do, but Allah is well-acquainted therewith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="132">128.  If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part, there is noblame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; andsuch settlement is best; even though men's souls are swayed by greed. But if yedo good and practise self-restraint, Allah is well-acquainted with all that yedo. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="133">129.  Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is yourardent desire: But turn not away [from a woman] altogether, so as to leave her[as it were] hanging [in the air]. If ye come to a friendly understanding, andpractise self-restraint, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="134">130.  But if they disagree [and must part], Allah will provide abundance for allfrom His all-reaching bounty: for Allah is He that careth for all and is Wise. </p>

Verily we havedirected the People of the Book before you, and you [o Muslims] to fear Allah.But if ye deny Him, lo! unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and onearth, and Allah is free of all wants, worthy of all praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="136">132.  Yea, unto Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and enoughis Allah to carry through all affairs. </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="139">135.  O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, evenas against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be [against]rich or poor: for Allah can best protect both. Follow not the lusts [of yourhearts], lest ye swerve, and if ye distort [justice] or decline to do justice,verily Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="140">136.  O ye who believe! Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the scripturewhich He hath sent to His Messenger and the scripture which He sent to thosebefore [him]. Any who denieth Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, andthe Day of Judgment, hath gone far, far astray. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="141">137.  Those who believe, then reject faith, then believe [again] and [again]reject faith, and go on increasing in unbelief,- Allah will not forgive them norguide them nor guide them on the way. </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="144">140.  Already has He sent you Word in the Book, that when ye hear the signs ofAllah held in defiance and ridicule, ye are not to sit with them unless theyturn to a different theme: if ye did, ye would be like them. For Allah willcollect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell:-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="145">141.  [These are] the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victoryfrom Allah, they say: "Were we not with you?"- but if the unbelievers gain asuccess, they say [to them]: "Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did wenot guard you from the believers?" but Allah will judge betwixt you on the Dayof Judgment. And never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way [to triumphs]over the believers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="146">142.  The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching Allah, but He will over­reach them: When they stand up to prayer, they stand without earnestness, to beseen of men, but little do they hold Allah in remembrance; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="147">143.  [They are] distracted in mind even in the midst of it,- being [sincerely]for neither one group nor for another whom Allah leaves straying,- never wiltthou find for him the way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="148">144.  O ye who believe! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers:Do ye wish to offer Allah an open proof against yourselves? </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="150">146.  Except for those who repent, mend [their lives] hold fast to Allah, andpurify their religion as in Allah's sight: if so they will be [numbered] withthe believers. And soon will Allah grant to the believers a reward of immensevalue. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="151">147.  What can Allah gain by your punishment, if ye are grateful and ye believe?Nay, it is Allah that recogniseth [all good], and knoweth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="152">148.  Allah loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech, exceptwhere injustice hath been done; for Allah is He who heareth and knoweth allthings. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="153">149.  Whether ye publish a good deed or conceal it or cover evil with pardon,verily Allah doth blot out [sins] and hath power [in the judgment of values]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="154">150.  Those who deny Allah and His messengers, and [those who] wish to separateAllah from His messengers, saying: "We believe in some but reject others": And[those who] wish to take a course midway,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="155">151.  They are in truth [equally] unbelievers; and we have prepared forunbelievers a humiliating punishment. </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="157">153.  The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them fromheaven: Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater [miracle], for they said:"Show us Allah in public," but they were dazed for their presumption, withthunder and lightning. Yet they worshipped the calf even after clear signs hadcome to them; even so we forgave them; and gave Moses manifest proofs ofauthority. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="158">154.  And for their covenant we raised over them [the towering height] of Mount[Sinai]; and [on another occasion] we said: "Enter the gate with humility"; and[once again] we commanded them: "Transgress not in the matter of the sabbath."And we took from them a solemn covenant. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="159">155.  [They have incurred divine displeasure]: In that they broke their covenant;that they rejected the signs of Allah; that they slew the Messengers in defianceof right; that they said, "Our hearts are the wrappings [which preserve Allah'sWord; We need no more]";- Nay, Allah hath set the seal on their hearts for theirblasphemy, and little is it they believe;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="160">156.  That they rejected Faith; that they uttered against Mary a grave falsecharge; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="161">157.  That they said [in boast], "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, theMessenger of Allah";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it wasmade to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no[certain] knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killedhim not:-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="162">158.  Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power,Wise;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="163">159.  And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him beforehis death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="164">160.  For the iniquity of the Jews We made unlawful for them certain [foods] goodand wholesome which had been lawful for them;- in that they hindered many fromAllah's Way;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="165">161.  That they took usury, though they were forbidden; and that they devouredmen's substance wrongfully;- we have prepared for those among them who rejectfaith a grievous punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="166">162.  But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge, and the believers,believe in what hath been revealed to thee and what was revealed before thee: And [especially] those who establish regular prayer and practise regular charityand believe in Allah and in the Last Day: To them shall We soon give a greatreward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="167">163.  We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengersafter him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes,to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="168">164.  Of some messengers We have already told thee the story; of others We havenot;- and to Moses Allah spoke direct;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="169">165.  Messengers who gave good news as well as warning, that mankind, after [thecoming] of the messengers, should have no plea against Allah: For Allah isExalted in Power, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="170">166.  But Allah beareth witness that what He hath sent unto thee He hath sent from His [own] knowledge, and the angels bear witness: But enough is Allah for awitness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="171">167.  Those who reject Faith and keep off [men] from the way of Allah, haveverily strayed far, far away from the Path. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="172">168.  Those who reject Faith and do wrong,- Allah will not forgive them nor guidethem to any way-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="173">169.  Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein for ever. And this to Allah iseasy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="174">170.  O Mankind! The Messenger hath come to you in truth from Allah: believe inhim: It is best for you. But if ye reject Faith, to Allah belong all things inthe heavens and on earth: And Allah is All-knowing, All-wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="175">171.  O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allahaught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was [no more than] a messengerof Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding fromHim: so believe in Allah and His messengers. Say not "Trinity" : desist: it willbe better for you: for Allah is one Allah: Glory be to Him: [far exalted is He]above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. Andenough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="176">172.  Christ disdaineth nor to serve and worship Allah, nor do the angels, thosenearest [to Allah]: those who disdain His worship and are arrogant,-He willgather them all together unto Himself to [answer]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="177">173.  But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, He will give their[due] rewards,- and more, out of His bounty: But those who are disdainful andarrogant, He will punish with a grievous penalty; Nor will they find, besidesAllah, any to protect or help them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="178">174.  O mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your Lord:For We have sent unto you a light [that is] manifest. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="179">175.  Then those who believe in Allah, and hold fast to Him,- soon will He admitthem to mercy and grace from Himself, and guide them to Himself by a straightway. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="180">176.  They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: Allah directs [thus] about thosewho leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If it is a man that dies,leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the inheritance: If [such adeceased was] a woman, who left no child, Her brother takes her inheritance: Ifthere are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance [betweenthem]: if there are brothers and sisters, [they share], the male having twicethe share of the female. Thus doth Allah make clear to you [His law], lest yeerr. And Allah hath knowledge of all things. </p>
