<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 83. Tatfif, or Dealing in Fraud </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Woe to those that deal in fraud,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, exact full measure, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  But when they have to give by measure or weight to men, give less than due. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Do they not think that they will be called to account?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  On a Mighty Day, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  A Day when [all] mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Nay! Surely the record of the wicked is [preserved] in Sijjin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  And what will explain to thee what Sijjin is? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  [There is] a Register [fully] inscribed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Woe, that Day, to those that deny-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Those that deny the Day of Judgment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And none can deny it but the Transgressor beyond bounds the Sinner! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  When Our Signs are rehearsed to him, he says, "Tales of the ancients!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  By no means! but on their hearts is the stain of the [ill] which they do! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Verily, from [the Light of] their Lord, that Day, will they be veiled. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Further, they will enter the Fire of Hell. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Further, it will be said to them: "This is the [reality] which ye rejectedas false! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Day, verily the record of the Righteous is [preserved] in 'Illiyin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And what will explain to thee what 'Illiyun is? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  [There is] a Register [fully] inscribed, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  To which bear witness those Nearest [to Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Truly the Righteous will be in Bliss: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  On Thrones [of Dignity] will they command a sight [of all things]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Thou wilt recognise in their faces the beaming brightness of Bliss. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Their thirst will be slaked with Pure Wine sealed: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  The seal thereof will be Musk: And for this let those aspire, who haveaspirations: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  With it will be [given] a mixture of Tasnim: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  A spring, from [the waters] whereof drink those Nearest to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Those in sin used to laugh at those who believed, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  And whenever they passed by them, used to wink at each other [in mockery]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And whenever they saw them, they would say, "Behold! These are the peopletruly astray!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  But they had not been sent as keepers over them! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  But on this Day the Believers will laugh at the Unbelievers: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  On Thrones [of Dignity] they will command [a sight] [of all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Will not the Unbelievers have been paid back for what they did? </p>
