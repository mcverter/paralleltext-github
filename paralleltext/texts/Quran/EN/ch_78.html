<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  About which they cannot agree. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Verily, they shall soon [come to] know! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Verily, verily they shall soon [come to] know! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  And the mountains as pegs? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  And [have We not] created you in pairs, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And made your sleep for rest, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And made the night as a covering, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  And made the day as a means of subsistence? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And [have We not] built over you the seven firmaments, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And placed [therein] a Light of Splendour? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  That We may produce therewith corn and vegetables, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  And gardens of luxurious growth? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Verily the Day of Sorting out is a thing appointed, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  The Day that the Trumpet shall be sounded, and ye shall come forth incrowds; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And the heavens shall be opened as if there were doors, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And the mountains shall vanish, as if they were a mirage. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Truly Hell is as a place of ambush, </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  They will dwell therein for ages. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Save a boiling fluid and a fluid, dark, murky, intensely cold, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  A fitting recompense [for them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  For that they used not to fear any account [for their deeds], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  But they [impudently] treated Our Signs as false. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  And all things have We preserved on record. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  "So taste ye [the fruits of your deeds]; for no increase shall We grant you,except in Punishment." </p>

<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Gardens enclosed, and grapevines; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  And voluptuous women of equal age; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  And a cup full [to the brim]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  No vanity shall they hear therein, nor Untruth:-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Recompense from thy Lord, a gift, [amply] sufficient, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  [From] the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all between, [Allah] MostGracious: None shall have power to argue with Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand forth in ranks, none shallspeak except any who is permitted by [Allah] Most Gracious, and He will say whatis right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  That Day will be the sure Reality: Therefore, whoso will, let him take a[straight] return to his Lord! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Verily, We have warned you of a Penalty near, the Day when man will see [thedeeds] which his hands have sent forth, and the Unbeliever will say, "Woe untome! Would that I were [metre] dust!" </p>
