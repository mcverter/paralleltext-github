<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 43. Zukhruf, or Gold Adornments </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Ha-Mim </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  By the Book that makes things clear,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  We have made it a Qur'an in Arabic, that ye may be able to understand [andlearn wisdom]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book, in Our Presence, high [indignity], full of wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Shall We then take away the Message from you and repel [you], for that ye area people transgressing beyond bounds? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  But how many were the prophets We sent amongst the peoples of old? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  And never came there a prophet to them but they mocked him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  So We destroyed [them]- stronger in power than these;- and [thus] has passedon the Parable of the peoples of old. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  If thou wert to question them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' Theywould be sure to reply, 'they were created by [Him], the Exalted in Power, Fullof Knowledge';-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  [Yea, the same that] has made for you the earth [like a carpet] spread out,and has made for you roads [and channels] therein, in order that ye may findguidance [on the way]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  That sends down [from time to time] rain from the sky in due measure;- andWe raise to life therewith a land that is dead; even so will ye be raised [fromthe dead];-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  That has created pairs in all things, and has made for you ships and cattleon which ye ride, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs, and when so seated,ye may celebrate the [kind] favour of your Lord, and say, "Glory to Him Who hassubjected these to our [use], for we could never have accomplished this [byourselves], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  "And to our Lord, surely, must we turn back!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Yet they attribute to some of His servants a share with Him [in hisgodhead]! truly is man a blasphemous ingrate avowed! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates, and granted toyou sons for choice? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  When news is brought to one of them of [the birth of] what he sets up as alikeness to [Allah] Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled withinward grief! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Is then one brought up among trinkets, and unable to give a clear account ina dispute [to be associated with Allah]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And they make into females angels who themselves serve Allah. Did theywitness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded, and they will be calledto account! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  ["Ah!"] they say, "If it had been the will of [Allah] Most Gracious, weshould not have worshipped such [deities]!" Of that they have no knowledge! theydo nothing but lie! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  What! have We given them a Book before this, to which they are holding fast? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Nay! they say: "We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we doguide ourselves by their footsteps." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Just in the same way, whenever We sent a Warner before thee to any people,the wealthy ones among them said: "We found our fathers following a certainreligion, and we will certainly follow in their footsteps." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  He said: "What! Even if I brought you better guidance than that which yefound your fathers following?" They said: "For us, we deny that ye [prophets]are sent [on a mission at all]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  So We exacted retribution from them: now see what was the end of those who rejected [Truth]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Behold! Abraham said to his father and his people: "I do indeed clear myselfof what ye worship: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "[I worship] only Him Who made me, and He will certainly guide me." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him, that theymay turn back [to Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Yea, I have given the good things of this life to these [men] and theirfathers, until the Truth has come to them, and a messenger making things clear. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  But when the Truth came to them, they said: "This is sorcery, and we doreject it." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Also, they say: "Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some leading man ineither of the two [chief] cities?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who portionout between them their livelihood in the life of this world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks, so that some may command work from others. Butthe Mercy of thy Lord is better than the [wealth] which they amass. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  And were it not that [all] men might become of one [evil] way of life, Wewould provide, for everyone that blasphemes against [Allah] Most Gracious,silver roofs for their houses and [silver] stair-ways on which to go up, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  And [silver] doors to their houses, and thrones [of silver] on which theycould recline, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  And also adornments of gold. But all this were nothing but conveniences ofthe present life: The Hereafter, in the sight of thy Lord is for the Righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  If anyone withdraws himself from remembrance of [Allah] Most Gracious, Weappoint for him an evil one, to be an intimate companion to him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Such [evil ones] really hinder them from the Path, but they think that theyare being guided aright! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  At length, when [such a one] comes to Us, he says [to his evil companion]:"Would that between me and thee were the distance of East and West!" Ah! evil is the companion [indeed]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  When ye have done wrong, it will avail you nothing, that Day, that ye shallbe partners in Punishment! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Canst thou then make the deaf to hear, or give direction to the blind or tosuch as [wander] in manifest error? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Even if We take thee away, We shall be sure to exact retribution from them, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Or We shall show thee that [accomplished] which We have promised them: forverily We shall prevail over them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  So hold thou fast to the Revelation sent down to thee; verily thou art on aStraight Way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  The [Qur'an] is indeed the message, for thee and for thy people; and soonshall ye [all] be brought to account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  And question thou our messengers whom We sent before thee; did We appointany deities other than [Allah] Most Gracious, to be worshipped? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  We did send Moses aforetime, with Our Signs, to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: Hesaid, "I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  But when he came to them with Our Signs, behold they ridiculed them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  We showed them Sign after Sign, each greater than its fellow, and We seizedthem with Punishment, in order that they might turn [to Us]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  And they said, "O thou sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord for us according to Hiscovenant with thee; for we shall truly accept guidance." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  But when We removed the Penalty from them, behold, they broke their word. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying: "O my people! Does not thedominion of Egypt belong to me, [witness] these streams flowing underneath my[palace]? What! see ye not then? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  "Am I not better than this [Moses], who is a contemptible wretch and canscarcely express himself clearly? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  "Then why are not gold bracelets bestowed on him, or [why] come [not] withhim angels accompanying him in procession?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  Thus did he make fools of his people, and they obeyed him: truly were they apeople rebellious [against Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  When at length they provoked Us, We exacted retribution from them, and Wedrowned them all. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  And We made them [a people] of the Past and an Example to later ages. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  When [Jesus] the son of Mary is held up as an example, behold, thy peopleraise a clamour thereat [in ridicule]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  And they say, "Are our gods best, or he?" This they set forth to thee, onlyby way of disputation: yea, they are a contentious people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  He was no more than a servant: We granted Our favour to him, and We made himan example to the Children of Israel. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  And if it were Our Will, We could make angels from amongst you, succeedingeach other on the earth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  And [Jesus] shall be a Sign [for the coming of] the Hour [of Judgment]:therefore have no doubt about the [Hour], but follow ye Me: this is a StraightWay. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  Let not the Evil One hinder you: for he is to you an enemy avowed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  When Jesus came with Clear Signs, he said: "Now have I come to you withWisdom, and in order to make clear to you some of the [points] on which yedispute: therefore fear Allah and obey me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  "For Allah, He is my Lord and your Lord: so worship ye Him: this is aStraight Way." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  But sects from among themselves fell into disagreement: then woe to thewrong-doers, from the Penalty of a Grievous Day! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  Do they only wait for the Hour - that it should come on them all of asudden, while they perceive not? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  Friends on that day will be foes, one to another,- except the Righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  My devotees! no fear shall be on you that Day, nor shall ye grieve,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  [Being] those who have believed in Our Signs and bowed [their wills to Ours]in Islam. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  Enter ye the Garden, ye and your wives, in [beauty and] rejoicing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  To them will be passed round, dishes and goblets of gold: there will bethere all that the souls could desire, all that their ayes could delight in: andye shall abide therein [for eye]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  Such will be the Garden of which ye are made heirs for your [good] deeds [inlife]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  Ye shall have therein abundance of fruit, from which ye shall havesatisfaction. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  The sinners will be in the Punishment of Hell, to dwell therein [for aye]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  Nowise will the [Punishment] be lightened for them, and in despair will theybe there overwhelmed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  Nowise shall We be unjust to them: but it is they who have been unjustthemselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  They will cry: "O Malik! would that thy Lord put an end to us!" He will say,"Nay, but ye shall abide!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  Verily We have brought the Truth to you: but most of you have a hatred forTruth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  What! have they settled some plan [among themselves]? But it is We Whosettle things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsels?Indeed [We do], and Our messengers are by them, to record. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  Say: "If [Allah] Most Gracious had a son, I would be the first to worship." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne [ofAuthority]! [He is free] from the things they attribute [to him]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  So leave them to babble and play [with vanities] until they meet that Day oftheirs, which they have been promised. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  It is He Who is Allah in heaven and Allah on earth; and He is full of Wisdomand Knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  And blessed is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth,and all between them: with Him is the Knowledge of the Hour [of Judgment]: andto Him shall ye be brought back. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  And those whom they invoke besides Allah have no power of intercession;-only he who bears witness to the Truth, and they know [him]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  If thou ask them, who created them, they will certainly say, Allah: How thenare they deluded away [from the Truth]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  [Allah has knowledge] of the [Prophet's] cry, "O my Lord! Truly these arepeople who will not believe!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  But turn away from them, and say "Peace!" But soon shall they know! </p>
