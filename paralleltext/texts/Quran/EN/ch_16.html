<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 16. Nahl, or The Bee </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  [Inevitable] cometh [to pass] the Command of Allah: seek ye not then tohasten it: Glory to Him, and far is He above having the partners they ascribeunto Him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  He doth send down His angels with inspiration of His Command, to such of Hisservants as He pleaseth, [saying]: "Warn [Man] that there is no god but I: so doyour duty unto Me." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  He has created the heavens and the earth for just ends: Far is He abovehaving the partners they ascribe to Him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  He has created man from a sperm-drop; and behold this same [man] becomes anopen disputer! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And cattle He has created for you [men]: from them ye derive warmth, andnumerous benefits, and of their [meat] ye eat. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And ye have a sense of pride and beauty in them as ye drive them home in theevening, and as ye lead them forth to pasture in the morning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  And they carry your heavy loads to lands that ye could not [otherwise] reachexcept with souls distressed: for your Lord is indeed Most Kind, Most Merciful, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  And [He has created] horses, mules, and donkeys, for you to ride and use forshow; and He has created [other] things of which ye have no knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And unto Allah leads straight the Way, but there are ways that turn aside: ifAllah had willed, He could have guided all of you. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  It is He who sends down rain from the sky: from it ye drink, and out of it[grows] the vegetation on which ye feed your cattle. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  With it He produces for you corn, olives, date-palms, grapes and every kindof fruit: verily in this is a sign for those who give thought. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  He has made subject to you the Night and the Day; the sun and the moon; andthe stars are in subjection by His Command: verily in this are Signs for men whoare wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And the things on this earth which He has multiplied in varying colours [andqualities]: verily in this is a sign for men who celebrate the praises of Allah[in gratitude]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  It is He Who has made the sea subject, that ye may eat thereof flesh that isfresh and tender, and that ye may extract therefrom ornaments to wear; and thouseest the ships therein that plough the waves, that ye may seek [thus] of thebounty of Allah and that ye may be grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  And He has set up on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shakewith you; and rivers and roads; that ye may guide yourselves; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  And marks and sign-posts; and by the stars [men] guide themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Is then He Who creates like one that creates not? Will ye not receiveadmonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  If ye would count up the favours of Allah, never would ye be able to numberthem: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And Allah doth know what ye conceal, and what ye reveal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Those whom they invoke besides Allah create nothing and are themselvescreated. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  [They are things] dead, lifeless: nor do they know when they will be raisedup. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Your Allah is one Allah: as to those who believe not in the Hereafter, theirhearts refuse to know, and they are arrogant. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Undoubtedly Allah doth know what they conceal, and what they reveal: verilyHe loveth not the arrogant. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  When it is said to them, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say,"Tales of the ancients!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Let them bear, on the Day of Judgment, their own burdens in full, and also[something] of the burdens of those without knowledge, whom they misled. Alas,how grievous the burdens they will bear! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Those before them did also plot [against Allah's Way]: but Allah took theirstructures from their foundations, and the roof fell down on them from above;and the Wrath seized them from directions they did not perceive. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will cover them with shame, and say: "Whereare My 'partners' concerning whom ye used to dispute [with the godly]?" Thoseendued with knowledge will say: "This Day, indeed, are the Unbelievers coveredwith shame and misery,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  "[Namely] those whose lives the angels take in a state of wrong-doing totheir own souls." Then would they offer submission [with the pretence], "We didno evil [knowingly]." [The angels will reply], "Nay, but verily Allah knowethall that ye did; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "So enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein. Thus evil indeed is the abodeof the arrogant." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  To the righteous [when] it is said, "What is it that your Lord hasrevealed?" they say, "All that is good." To those who do good, there is good inthis world, and the Home of the Hereafter is even better and excellent indeed isthe Home of the righteous,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Gardens of Eternity which they will enter: beneath them flow [pleasant]rivers: they will have therein all that they wish: thus doth Allah reward therighteous,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  [Namely] those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity, saying [tothem], "Peace be on you; enter ye the Garden, because of [the good] which ye did[in the world]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Do the [ungodly] wait until the angels come to them, or there comes theCommand of thy Lord [for their doom]? So did those who went before them. ButAllah wronged them not: nay, they wronged their own souls. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  But the evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that very [Wrath] atwhich they had scoffed hemmed them in. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  The worshippers of false gods say: "If Allah had so willed, we should nothave worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers,- nor should we haveprescribed prohibitions other than His." So did those who went before them. Butwhat is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, [with the Command],"Serve Allah, and eschew Evil": of the People were some whom Allah guided, andsome on whom error became inevitably [established]. So travel through the earth,and see what was the end of those who denied [the Truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  If thou art anxious for their guidance, yet Allah guideth not such as Heleaves to stray, and there is none to help them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  They swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that Allah will not raise upthose who die: Nay, but it is a promise [binding] on Him in truth: but mostamong mankind realise it not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  [They must be raised up], in order that He may manifest to them the truth ofthat wherein they differ, and that the rejecters of Truth may realise that theyhad indeed [surrendered to] Falsehood. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  For to anything which We have willed, We but say the word, "Be", and it is. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  To those who leave their homes in the cause of Allah, after sufferingoppression,- We will assuredly give a goodly home in this world; but truly thereward of the Hereafter will be greater. If they only realised [this]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  [They are] those who persevere in patience, and put their trust on theirLord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  And before thee also the messengers We sent were but men, to whom We grantedinspiration: if ye realise this not, ask of those who possess the Message. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  [We sent them] with Clear Signs and Books of dark prophecies; and We havesent down unto thee [also] the Message; that thou mayest explain clearly to menwhat is sent for them, and that they may give thought. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Do then those who devise evil [plots] feel secure that Allah will not causethe earth to swallow them up, or that the Wrath will not seize them fromdirections they little perceive?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their goings to andfro, without a chance of their frustrating Him?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Or that He may not call them to account by a process of slow wastage - forthy Lord is indeed full of kindness and mercy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  Do they not look at Allah's creation, [even] among [inanimate] things,- Howtheir [very] shadows turn round, from the right and the left, prostratingthemselves to Allah, and that in the humblest manner? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  And to Allah doth obeisance all that is in the heavens and on earth, whethermoving [living] creatures or the angels: for none are arrogant [before theirLord]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  They all revere their Lord, high above them, and they do all that they arecommanded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  Allah has said: "Take not [for worship] two gods: for He is just One Allah:then fear Me [and Me alone]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth, and to Him is dutydue always: then will ye fear other than Allah? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  And ye have no good thing but is from Allah: and moreover, when ye aretouched by distress, unto Him ye cry with groans; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  Yet, when He removes the distress from you, behold! some of you turn toother gods to join with their Lord-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  [As if] to show their ingratitude for the favours we have bestowed on them!then enjoy [your brief day]: but soon will ye know [your folly]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  And they [even] assign, to things they do not know, a portion out of thatwhich We have bestowed for their sustenance! By Allah, ye shall certainly becalled to account for your false inventions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  And they assign daughters for Allah! - Glory be to Him! - and for themselves[sons,- the issue] they desire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  When news is brought to one of them, of [the birth of] a female [child], hisface darkens, and he is filled with inward grief! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  With shame does he hide himself from his people, because of the bad news hehas had! Shall he retain it on [sufferance and] contempt, or bury it in thedust? Ah! what an evil [choice] they decide on? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  To those who believe not in the Hereafter, applies the similitude of evil:to Allah applies the highest similitude: for He is the Exalted in Power, full ofWisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  If Allah were to punish men for their wrong-doing, He would not leave, onthe [earth], a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a statedTerm: When their Term expires, they would not be able to delay [the punishment]for a single hour, just as they would not be able to anticipate it [for a singlehour]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  They attribute to Allah what they hate [for themselves], and their tonguesassert the falsehood that all good things are for themselves: without doubt forthem is the Fire, and they will be the first to be hastened on into it! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  By Allah, We [also] sent [Our messengers] to Peoples before thee; but Satanmade, [to the wicked], their own acts seem alluring: He is also their patrontoday, but they shall have a most grievous penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  And We sent down the Book to thee for the express purpose, that thoushouldst make clear to them those things in which they differ, and that itshould be a guide and a mercy to those who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  And Allah sends down rain from the skies, and gives therewith life to theearth after its death: verily in this is a Sign for those who listen. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  And verily in cattle [too] will ye find an instructive sign. From what iswithin their bodies between excretions and blood, We produce, for your drink,milk, pure and agreeable to those who drink it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out wholesome drinkand food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in[men's] habitations; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  Then to eat of all the produce [of the earth], and find with skill thespacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink ofvarying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for thosewho give thought. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  It is Allah who creates you and takes your souls at death; and of you thereare some who are sent back to a feeble age, so that they know nothing afterhaving known [much]: for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  Allah has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you thanon others: those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to thosewhom their right hands possess, so as to be equal in that respect. Will theythen deny the favours of Allah? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  And Allah has made for you mates [and companions] of your own nature, andmade for you, out of them, sons and daughters and grandchildren, and providedfor you sustenance of the best: will they then believe in vain things, and beungrateful for Allah's favours?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  And worship others than Allah,- such as have no power of providing them, forsustenance, with anything in heavens or earth, and cannot possibly have suchpower? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  Invent not similitudes for Allah: for Allah knoweth, and ye know not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  Allah sets forth the Parable [of two men: one] a slave under the dominion ofanother; He has no power of any sort; and [the other] a man on whom We havebestowed goodly favours from Ourselves, and he spends thereof [freely],privately and publicly: are the two equal? [By no means;] praise be to Allah.But most of them understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  Allah sets forth [another] Parable of two men: one of them dumb, with nopower of any sort; a wearisome burden is he to his master; whichever way bedirects him, he brings no good: is such a man equal with one who commandsJustice, and is on a Straight Way? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  To Allah belongeth the Mystery of the heavens and the earth. And theDecision of the Hour [of Judgment] is as the twinkling of an eye, or evenquicker: for Allah hath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  It is He Who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when ye knewnothing; and He gave you hearing and sight and intelligence and affections: thatye may give thanks [to Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  Do they not look at the birds, held poised in the midst of [the air and] thesky? Nothing holds them up but [the power of] Allah. Verily in this are signsfor those who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  It is Allah Who made your habitations homes of rest and quiet for you; andmade for you, out of the skins of animals, [tents for] dwellings, which ye findso light [and handy] when ye travel and when ye stop [in your travels]; and outof their wool, and their soft fibres [between wool and hair], and their hair,rich stuff and articles of convenience [to serve you] for a time. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  It is Allah Who made out of the things He created, some things to give youshade; of the hills He made some for your shelter; He made you garments toprotect you from heat, and coats of mail to protect you from your [mutual]violence. Thus does He complete His favours on you, that ye may bow to His Will[in Islam]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  But if they turn away, thy duty is only to preach the clear Message. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  They recognise the favours of Allah; then they deny them; and most of themare [creatures] ungrateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  One Day We shall raise from all Peoples a Witness: then will no excuse beaccepted from Unbelievers, nor will they receive any favours. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  When the wrong-doers [actually] see the Penalty, then will it in no way bemitigated, nor will they then receive respite. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  When those who gave partners to Allah will see their "partners", they willsay: "Our Lord! these are our 'partners,' those whom we used to invoke besidesThee." But they will throw back their word at them [and say]: "Indeed ye areliars!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  That Day shall they [openly] show [their] submission to Allah; and all theirinventions shall leave them in the lurch. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  Those who reject Allah and hinder [men] from the Path of Allah - for themwill We add Penalty to Penalty; for that they used to spread mischief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  One day We shall raise from all Peoples a witness against them, from amongstthemselves: and We shall bring thee as a witness against these [thy people]: andWe have sent down to thee the Book explaining all things, a Guide, a Mercy, andGlad Tidings to Muslims. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  Allah commands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to kith and kin,and He forbids all shameful deeds, and injustice and rebellion: He instructsyou, that ye may receive admonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  Fulfil the Covenant of Allah when ye have entered into it, and break notyour oaths after ye have confirmed them; indeed ye have made Allah your surety;for Allah knoweth all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  And be not like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which shehas spun, after it has become strong. Nor take your oaths to practise deceptionbetween yourselves, lest one party should be more numerous than another: forAllah will test you by this; and on the Day of Judgment He will certainly makeclear to you [the truth of] that wherein ye disagree. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  If Allah so willed, He could make you all one people: But He leaves strayingwhom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases: but ye shall certainly be calledto account for all your actions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  And take not your oaths, to practise deception between yourselves, with theresult that someone's foot may slip after it was firmly planted, and ye may haveto taste the evil [consequences] of having hindered [men] from the Path ofAllah, and a Mighty Wrath descend on you. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  Nor sell the covenant of Allah for a miserable price: for with Allah is [aprize] far better for you, if ye only knew. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  What is with you must vanish: what is with Allah will endure. And We willcertainly bestow, on those who patiently persevere, their reward according tothe best of their actions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">97.  Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, verily, to himwill We give a new Life, a life that is good and pure and We will bestow on suchtheir reward according to the best of their actions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">98.  When thou dost read the Qur'an, seek Allah's protection from Satan therejected one. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">99.  No authority has he over those who believe and put their trust in theirLord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">100.  His authority is over those only, who take him as patron and who joinpartners with Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">101.  When We substitute one revelation for another,- and Allah knows best whatHe reveals [in stages],- they say, "Thou art but a forger": but most of themunderstand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">102.  Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from thy Lord in Truth, inorder to strengthen those who believe, and as a Guide and Glad Tidings toMuslims. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">103.  We know indeed that they say, "It is a man that teaches him." The tongue ofhim they wickedly point to is notably foreign, while this is Arabic, pure andclear. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">104.  Those who believe not in the Signs of Allah,- Allah will not guide them,and theirs will be a grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">105.  It is those who believe not in the Signs of Allah, that forge falsehood: itis they who lie! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">106.  Any one who, after accepting faith in Allah, utters Unbelief,- except undercompulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith - but such as open their breast toUnbelief, on them is Wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">107.  This because they love the life of this world better than the Hereafter:and Allah will not guide those who reject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">108.  Those are they whose hearts, ears, and eyes Allah has sealed up, and theytake no heed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">109.  Without doubt, in the Hereafter they will perish. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">110.  But verily thy Lord,- to those who leave their homes after trials andpersecutions,- and who thereafter strive and fight for the faith and patientlypersevere,- Thy Lord, after all this is oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">111.  One Day every soul will come up struggling for itself, and every soul willbe recompensed [fully] for all its actions, and none will be unjustly dealtwith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">112.  Allah sets forth a Parable: a city enjoying security and quiet, abundantlysupplied with sustenance from every place: Yet was it ungrateful for the favoursof Allah: so Allah made it taste of hunger and terror [in extremes] [closing inon it] like a garment [from every side], because of the [evil] which [itspeople] wrought. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">113.  And there came to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they falselyrejected him; so the Wrath seized them even in the midst of their iniquities. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">114.  So eat of the sustenance which Allah has provided for you, lawful and good;and be grateful for the favours of Allah, if it is He Whom ye serve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">115.  He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, andany [food] over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked. But if oneis forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing duelimits,- then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">116.  But say not - for any false thing that your tongues may put forth,- "Thisis lawful, and this is forbidden," so as to ascribe false things to Allah. Forthose who ascribe false things to Allah, will never prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">117.  [In such falsehood] is but a paltry profit; but they will have a mostgrievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">118.  To the Jews We prohibited such things as We have mentioned to thee before:We did them no wrong, but they were used to doing wrong to themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">119.  But verily thy Lord,- to those who do wrong in ignorance, but whothereafter repent and make amends,- thy Lord, after all this, is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">120.  Abraham was indeed a model, devoutly obedient to Allah, [and] true inFaith, and he joined not gods with Allah: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="122">121.  He showed his gratitude for the favours of Allah, who chose him, and guidedhim to a Straight Way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">122.  And We gave him Good in this world, and he will be, in the Hereafter, inthe ranks of the Righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">123.  So We have taught thee the inspired [Message], "Follow the ways of Abrahamthe True in Faith, and he joined not gods with Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="125">124.  The Sabbath was only made [strict] for those who disagreed [as to itsobservance]; But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, as totheir differences. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="126">125.  Invite [all] to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching;and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy Lordknoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="127">126.  And if ye do catch them out, catch them out no worse than they catch youout: But if ye show patience, that is indeed the best [course] for those who arepatient. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="128">127.  And do thou be patient, for thy patience is but from Allah; nor grieve overthem: and distress not thyself because of their plots. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="129">128.  For Allah is with those who restrain themselves, and those who do good. </p>
