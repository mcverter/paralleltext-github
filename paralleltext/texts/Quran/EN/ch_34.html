<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 34. Saba, or the City of Saba </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Praise be to Allah, to Whom belong all things in the heavens and on earth: toHim be Praise in the Hereafter: and He is Full of Wisdom, acquainted with allthings. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  He knows all that goes into the earth, and all that comes out thereof; allthat comes down from the sky and all that ascends thereto and He is the MostMerciful, the Oft-Forgiving. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  The Unbelievers say, "Never to us will come the Hour": Say, "Nay! but mostsurely, by my Lord, it will come upon you;- by Him Who knows the unseen,- fromWhom is not hidden the least little atom in the heavens or on earth: Nor is there anything less than that, or greater, but is in the Record Perspicuous: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  That He may reward those who believe and work deeds of righteousness: forsuch is Forgiveness and a Sustenance Most Generous." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  But those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them,- for such will bea Penalty,- a Punishment most humiliating. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And those to whom knowledge has come see that the [Revelation] sent down tothee from thy Lord - that is the Truth, and that it guides to the Path of theExalted [in might], Worthy of all praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  The Unbelievers say [in ridicule]: "Shall we point out to you a man that willtell you, when ye are all scattered to pieces in disintegration, that ye shall[then be raised] in a New Creation? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  "Has he invented a falsehood against Allah, or has a spirit [seized] him?"-Nay, it is those who believe not in the Hereafter, that are in [real] Penalty,and in farthest error. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  See they not what is before them and behind them, of the sky and the earth?If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause a piece ofthe sky to fall upon them. Verily in this is a Sign for every devotee that turnsto Allah [in repentance]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  We bestowed Grace aforetime on David from ourselves: "O ye Mountains! Singye back the Praises of Allah with him! and ye birds [also]! And We made the ironsoft for him;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  [Commanding], "Make thou coast of mail, balancing well the rings of chainarmour, and work ye righteousness; for be sure I see [clearly] all that ye do." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And to Solomon [We made] the Wind [obedient]: Its early morning [stride] wasa month's [journey], and its evening [stride] was a month's [journey]; and Wemade a Font of molten brass to flow for him; and there were Jinns that worked infront of him, by the leave of his Lord, and if any of them turned aside from ourcommand, We made him taste of the Penalty of the Blazing Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  They worked for him as he desired, [making] arches, images, basins as largeas reservoirs, and [cooking] cauldrons fixed [in their places]: "Work ye, sonsof David, with thanks! but few of My servants are grateful!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Then, when We decreed [Solomon's] death, nothing showed them his deathexcept a little worm of the earth, which kept [slowly] gnawing away at hisstaff: so when he fell down, the Jinns saw plainly that if they had known theunseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty [of their Task]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  There was, for Saba, aforetime, a Sign in their home-land - two Gardens tothe right and to the left. "Eat of the Sustenance [provided] by your Lord, andbe grateful to Him: a territory fair and happy, and a Lord Oft-Forgiving! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  But they turned away [from Allah], and We sent against them the Flood[released] from the dams, and We converted their two garden [rows] into"gardens" producing bitter fruit, and tamarisks, and some few [stunted] Lote­trees. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  That was the Requital We gave them because they ungratefully rejected Faith:and never do We give [such] requital except to such as are ungrateful rejecters. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Between them and the Cities on which We had poured our blessings, We hadplaced Cities in prominent positions, and between them We had appointed stagesof journey in due proportion: "Travel therein, secure, by night and by day." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  But they said: "Our Lord! Place longer distances between our journey-stages": but they wronged themselves [therein]. At length We made them as a tale[that is told], and We dispersed them all in scattered fragments. Verily in thisare Signs for every [soul that is] patiently constant and grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And on them did Satan prove true his idea, and they followed him, all but aparty that believed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  But he had no authority over them,- except that We might test the man whobelieves in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt concerning it: and thy Lorddoth watch over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Say: "Call upon other [gods] whom ye fancy, besides Allah: They have nopower,- not the weight of an atom,- in the heavens or on earth: No [sort of]share have they therein, nor is any of them a helper to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  "No intercession can avail in His Presence, except for those for whom He hasgranted permission. So far [is this the case] that, when terror is removed fromtheir hearts [at the Day of Judgment, then] will they say, 'what is it that yourLord commanded?' they will say, 'That which is true and just; and He is the MostHigh Most Great'." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Say: "Who gives you sustenance, from the heavens and the earth?" Say: "It isAllah; and certain it is that either we or ye are on right guidance or inmanifest error!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Say: "Ye shall not be questioned as to our sins, nor shall we be questionedas to what ye do." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Say: "Our Lord will gather us together and will in the end decide the matterbetween us [and you] in truth and justice: and He is the one to decide, the OneWho knows all." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  Say: "Show me those whom ye have joined with Him as partners: by no means[can ye]. Nay, He is Allah, the Exalted in Power, the Wise." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  We have not sent thee but as a universal [Messenger] to men, giving themglad tidings, and warning them [against sin], but most men understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  They say: "When will this promise [come to pass] if ye are telling thetruth?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Say: "The appointment to you is for a Day, which ye cannot put back for anhour nor put forward." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  The Unbelievers say: "We shall neither believe in this scripture nor in[any] that [came] before it." Couldst thou but see when the wrong-doers will bemade to stand before their Lord, throwing back the word [of blame] on oneanother! Those who had been despised will say to the arrogant ones: "Had it notbeen for you, we should certainly have been believers!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  The arrogant ones will say to those who had been despised: "Was it we whokept you back from Guidance after it reached you? Nay, rather, it was ye whotransgressed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Those who had been despised will say to the arrogant ones: "Nay! it was aplot [of yours] by day and by night: Behold! Ye [constantly] ordered us to beungrateful to Allah and to attribute equals to Him!" They will declare [their]repentance when they see the Penalty: We shall put yokes on the necks of theUnbelievers: It would only be a requital for their [ill] Deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Never did We send a warner to a population, but the wealthy ones among themsaid: "We believe not in the [Message] with which ye have been sent." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  They said: "We have more in wealth and in sons, and we cannot be punished." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Provision to whom Hepleases, but most men understand not." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  It is not your wealth nor your sons, that will bring you nearer to Us indegree: but only those who believe and work righteousness - these are the onesfor whom there is a multiplied Reward for their deeds, while secure they[reside] in the dwellings on high! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Those who strive against Our Signs, to frustrate them, will be given overinto Punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Sustenance to such of hisservants as He pleases: and nothing do ye spend in the least [in His cause] butHe replaces it: for He is the Best of those who grant Sustenance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  One Day He will gather them all together, and say to the angels, "Was it youthat these men used to worship?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">341. They will say, "Glory to Thee! our [tie] is with Thee - as Protector - notwith them. Nay, but they worshipped the Jinns: most of them believed in them."  42.  So on that Day no power shall they have over each other, for profit or harm:and We shall say to the wrong-doers, "Taste ye the Penalty of the Fire,- thewhich ye were wont to deny!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">43.  When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, they say, "This is only a manwho wishes to hinder you from the [worship] which your fathers practised." Andthey say, "This is only a falsehood invented!" and the Unbelievers say of theTruth when it comes to them, "This is nothing but evident magic!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">44.  But We had not given them Books which they could study, nor sent messengersto them before thee as Warners. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">45.  And their predecessors rejected [the Truth]; these have not received a tenthof what We had granted to those: yet when they rejected My messengers, how[terrible] was My rejection [of them]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">46.  Say: "I do admonish you on one point: that ye do stand up before Allah,- [Itmay be] in pairs, or [it may be] singly,- and reflect [within yourselves]: yourCompanion is not possessed: he is no less than a warner to you, in face of aterrible Penalty." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">47.  Say: "No reward do I ask of you: it is [all] in your interest: my reward isonly due from Allah: And He is witness to all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">48.  Say: "Verily my Lord doth cast the [mantle of] Truth [over His servants],-He that has full knowledge of [all] that is hidden." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">49.  Say: "The Truth has arrived, and Falsehood neither creates anything new, norrestores anything." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">50.  Say: "If I am astray, I only stray to the loss of my own soul: but if Ireceive guidance, it is because of the inspiration of my Lord to me: it is HeWho hears all things, and is [ever] near." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">51.  If thou couldst but see when they will quake with terror; but then therewill be no escape [for them], and they will be seized from a position [quite]near. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">52.  And they will say, "We do believe [now] in the [Truth]"; but how could theyreceive [Faith] from a position [so far off,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">53.  Seeing that they did reject Faith [entirely] before, and that they[continually] cast [slanders] on the unseen from a position far off? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">54.  And between them and their desires, is placed a barrier, as was done in thepast with their partisans: for they were indeed in suspicious [disquieting]doubt. </p>
