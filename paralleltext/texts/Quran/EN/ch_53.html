<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 53. Najm, or the Star </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  By the Star when it goes down,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Your Companion is neither astray nor being misled. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Nor does he say [aught] of [his own] Desire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  It is no less than inspiration sent down to him: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  He was taught by one Mighty in Power, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Endued with Wisdom: for he appeared [in stately form]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  While he was in the highest part of the horizon: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Then he approached and came closer, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or [even] nearer; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  So did [Allah] convey the inspiration to His Servant- [conveyed] what He[meant] to convey. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  The [Prophet's] [mind and] heart in no way falsified that which he saw. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he saw? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  For indeed he saw him at a second descent, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Near the Lote-tree beyond which none may pass: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Near it is the Garden of Abode. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Behold, the Lote-tree was shrouded [in mystery unspeakable!] </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  [His] sight never swerved, nor did it go wrong! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  For truly did he see, of the Signs of his Lord, the Greatest! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Have ye seen Lat. and 'Uzza, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And another, the third [goddess], Manat? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  What! for you the male sex, and for Him, the female? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Behold, such would be indeed a division most unfair! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  These are nothing but names which ye have devised,- ye and your fathers,-for which Allah has sent down no authority [whatever]. They follow nothing butconjecture and what their own souls desire!- Even though there has already cometo them Guidance from their Lord! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Nay, shall man have [just] anything he hankers after? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  But it is to Allah that the End and the Beginning [of all things] belong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  How many-so-ever be the angels in the heavens, their intercession will availnothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He pleases and that he isacceptable to Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  Those who believe not in the Hereafter, name the angels with female names. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  But they have no knowledge therein. They follow nothing but conjecture; andconjecture avails nothing against Truth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Therefore shun those who turn away from Our Message and desire nothing butthe life of this world. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  That is as far as knowledge will reach them. Verily thy Lord knoweth bestthose who stray from His Path, and He knoweth best those who receive guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Yea, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: so that Herewards those who do evil, according to their deeds, and He rewards those who dogood, with what is best. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, only [falling into] smallfaults,- verily thy Lord is ample in forgiveness. He knows you well when Hebrings you out of the earth, And when ye are hidden in your mothers' wombs.Therefore justify not yourselves: He knows best who it is that guards againstevil. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Seest thou one who turns back, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Gives a little, then hardens [his heart]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  What! Has he knowledge of the Unseen so that he can see? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Nay, is he not acquainted with what is in the Books of Moses-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  And of Abraham who fulfilled his engagements?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  That man can have nothing but what he strives for; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  That [the fruit of] his striving will soon come in sight: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Then will he be rewarded with a reward complete; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  That to thy Lord is the final Goal; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  That it is He Who granteth Laughter and Tears; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  That it is He Who granteth Death and Life; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  That He did create in pairs,- male and female, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  From a seed when lodged [in its place]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  That He hath promised a Second Creation [Raising of the Dead]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  That it is He Who giveth wealth and satisfaction; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  That He is the Lord of Sirius [the Mighty Star]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  And that it is He Who destroyed the [powerful] ancient 'Ad [people], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  And the Thamud nor gave them a lease of perpetual life. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  And before them, the people of Noah, for that they were [all] most unjustand most insolent transgressors, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities [of Sodom and Gomorrah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  So that [ruins unknown] have covered them up. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  Then which of the gifts of thy Lord, [O man,] wilt thou dispute about? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  This is a Warner, of the [series of] Warners of old! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  The [Judgment] ever approaching draws nigh: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  No [soul] but Allah can lay it bare. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  Do ye then wonder at this recital? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  And will ye laugh and not weep,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  Wasting your time in vanities? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  But fall ye down in prostration to Allah, and adore [Him]! </p>
