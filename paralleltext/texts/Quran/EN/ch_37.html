<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 37. Saffat, or Those Ranged in Ranks </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  By those who range themselves in ranks, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  And so are strong in repelling [evil], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And thus proclaim the Message [of Allah]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Verily, verily, your Allah is one!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all between them, and Lord of everypoint at the rising of the sun! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  We have indeed decked the lower heaven with beauty [in] the stars,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  [For beauty] and for guard against all obstinate rebellious evil spirits, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  [So] they should not strain their ears in the direction of the ExaltedAssembly but be cast away from every side, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Repulsed, for they are under a perpetual penalty, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Except such as snatch away something by stealth, and they are pursued by aflaming fire, of piercing brightness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Just ask their opinion: are they the more difficult to create, or the[other] beings We have created? Them have We created out of a sticky clay! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Truly dost thou marvel, while they ridicule, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And, when they are admonished, pay no heed,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And, when they see a Sign, turn it to mockery, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  And say, "This is nothing but evident sorcery! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  "What! when we die, and become dust and bones, shall we [then] be raised up[again] </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  "And also our fathers of old?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Say thou: "Yea, and ye shall then be humiliated [on account of your evil]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Then it will be a single [compelling] cry; and behold, they will begin tosee! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  They will say, "Ah! Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  [A voice will say,] "This is the Day of Sorting Out, whose truth ye [once]denied!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  "Bring ye up", it shall be said, "The wrong-doers and their wives, and thethings they worshipped-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  "Besides Allah, and lead them to the Way to the [Fierce] Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  "But stop them, for they must be asked: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  "'What is the matter with you that ye help not each other?'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Nay, but that day they shall submit [to Judgment]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And they will turn to one another, and question one another. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  They will say: "It was ye who used to come to us from the right hand [ofpower and authority]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  They will reply: "Nay, ye yourselves had no Faith! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  "Nor had we any authority over you. Nay, it was ye who were a people inobstinate rebellion! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  "So now has been proved true, against us, the word of our Lord that we shallindeed [have to] taste [the punishment of our sins]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  "We led you astray: for truly we were ourselves astray." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Truly, that Day, they will [all] share in the Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Verily that is how We shall deal with Sinners. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  For they, when they were told that there is no god except Allah, would puffthemselves up with Pride, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  And say: "What! shall we give up our gods for the sake of a Poet possessed?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Nay! he has come with the [very] Truth, and he confirms [the Message of] themessengers [before him]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Ye shall indeed taste of the Grievous Penalty;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  But it will be no more than the retribution of [the Evil] that ye havewrought;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  But the sincere [and devoted] Servants of Allah,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  For them is a Sustenance determined, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Fruits [Delights]; and they [shall enjoy] honour and dignity, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  In Gardens of Felicity, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Facing each other on Thrones [of Dignity]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Round will be passed to them a Cup from a clear-flowing fountain, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Crystal-white, of a taste delicious to those who drink [thereof], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Free from headiness; nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  And besides them will be chaste women, restraining their glances, with bigeyes [of wonder and beauty]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  As if they were [delicate] eggs closely guarded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  Then they will turn to one another and question one another. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  One of them will start the talk and say: "I had an intimate companion [onthe earth], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  "Who used to say, 'what! art thou amongst those who bear witness to theTruth [of the Message]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  "'When we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed receive rewards andpunishments?'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  [A voice] said: "Would ye like to look down?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  He looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  He said: "By Allah! thou wast little short of bringing me to perdition! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  "Had it not been for the Grace of my Lord, I should certainly have beenamong those brought [there]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  "Is it [the case] that we shall not die, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  "Except our first death, and that we shall not be punished?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  Verily this is the supreme achievement! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  For the like of this let all strive, who wish to strive. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  Is that the better entertainment or the Tree of Zaqqum? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  For We have truly made it [as] a trial for the wrong-doers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-Fire: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  Then on top of that they will be given a mixture made of boiling water. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  Then shall their return be to the [Blazing] Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  Truly they found their fathers on the wrong Path; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  So they [too] were rushed down on their footsteps! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  And truly before them, many of the ancients went astray;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  But We sent aforetime, among them, [messengers] to admonish them;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  Then see what was the end of those who were admonished [but heeded not],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  Except the sincere [and devoted] Servants of Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  [In the days of old], Noah cried to Us, and We are the best to hear prayer. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  And We delivered him and his people from the Great Calamity, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  And made his progeny to endure [on this earth]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  And We left [this blessing] for him among generations to come in latertimes: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  "Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  Thus indeed do we reward those who do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  For he was one of our believing Servants. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  Then the rest we overwhelmed in the Flood. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  Verily among those who followed his Way was Abraham. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  Behold! he approached his Lord with a sound heart. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  Behold! he said to his father and to his people, "What is that which yeworship? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  "Is it a falsehood- gods other than Allah- that ye desire? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  "Then what is your idea about the Lord of the worlds?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  Then did he cast a glance at the Stars. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  And he said, "I am indeed sick [at heart]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  So they turned away from him, and departed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  Then did he turn to their gods and said, "will ye not eat [of the offeringsbefore you]?... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  "What is the matter with you that ye speak not [intelligently]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  Then did he turn upon them, striking [them] with the right hand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  Then came [the worshippers] with hurried steps, and faced [him]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  He said: "Worship ye that which ye have [yourselves] carved? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  "But Allah has created you and your handwork!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">97.  They said, "Build him a furnace, and throw him into the blazing fire!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">98.  [This failing], they then sought a stratagem against him, but We made themthe ones most humiliated! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">99.  He said: "I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">100.  "O my Lord! Grant me a righteous [son]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">101.  So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">102.  Then, when [the son] reached [the age of] [serious] work with him, he said:"O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thyview!" [The son] said: "O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will findme, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">103.  So when they had both submitted their wills [to Allah], and he had laid himprostrate on his forehead [for sacrifice], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">104.  We called out to him "O Abraham! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">105.  "Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!" - thus indeed do We reward thosewho do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">106.  For this was obviously a trial-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">107.  And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">108.  And We left [this blessing] for him among generations [to come] in latertimes: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">109.  "Peace and salutation to Abraham!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">110.  Thus indeed do We reward those who do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">111.  For he was one of our believing Servants. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">112.  And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet,- one of the Righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">113.  We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are [some] that do right,and [some] that obviously do wrong, to their own souls. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">114.  Again [of old] We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">115.  And We delivered them and their people from [their] Great Calamity; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">116.  And We helped them, so they overcame [their troubles]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">117.  And We gave them the Book which helps to make things clear; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">118.  And We guided them to the Straight Way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">119.  And We left [this blessing] for them among generations [to come] in latertimes: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">120.  "Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="122">121.  Thus indeed do We reward those who do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">122.  For they were two of our believing Servants. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">123.  So also was Elias among those sent [by Us]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="125">124.  Behold, he said to his people, "Will ye not fear [Allah]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="126">125.  "Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the Best of Creators,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="127">126.  "Allah, your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathersof old?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="128">127.  But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up [forpunishment],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="129">128.  Except the sincere and devoted Servants of Allah [among them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="130">129.  And We left [this blessing] for him among generations [to come] in latertimes: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="131">130.  "Peace and salutation to such as Elias!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="132">131.  Thus indeed do We reward those who do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="133">132.  For he was one of our believing Servants. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="134">133.  So also was Lut among those sent [by Us]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="135">134.  Behold, We delivered him and his adherents, all </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="136">135.  Except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="137">136.  Then We destroyed the rest. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="138">137.  Verily, ye pass by their [sites], by day-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="139">138.  And by night: will ye not understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="140">139.  So also was Jonah among those sent [by Us]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="141">140.  When he ran away [like a slave from captivity] to the ship [fully] laden, 3141. He [agreed to] cast lots, and he was condemned: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="142">142.  Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="143">143.  Had it not been that he [repented and] glorified Allah, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="144">144.  He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day ofResurrection. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="145">145.  But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="146">146.  And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="147">147.  And We sent him [on a mission] to a hundred thousand [men] or more. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="148">148.  And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy [their life] for a while. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="149">149.  Now ask them their opinion: Is it that thy Lord has [only] daughters, andthey have sons?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="150">150.  Or that We created the angels female, and they are witnesses [thereto]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="151">151.  Is it not that they say, from their own invention, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="152">152.  "Allah has begotten children"? but they are liars! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="153">153.  Did He [then] choose daughters rather than sons? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="154">154.  What is the matter with you? How judge ye? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="155">155.  Will ye not then receive admonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="156">156.  Or have ye an authority manifest? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="157">157.  Then bring ye your Book [of authority] if ye be truthful! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="158">158.  And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the Jinns: butthe Jinns know [quite well] that they have indeed to appear [before hisJudgment-Seat]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="159">159.  Glory to Allah! [He is free] from the things they ascribe [to Him]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="160">160.  Not [so do] the Servants of Allah, sincere and devoted. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="161">161.  For, verily, neither ye nor those ye worship-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="162">162.  Can lead [any] into temptation concerning Allah, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="163">163.  Except such as are [themselves] going to the blazing Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="164">164.  [Those ranged in ranks say]: "Not one of us but has a place appointed; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="165">165.  "And we are verily ranged in ranks [for service]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="166">166.  "And we are verily those who declare [Allah's] glory!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="167">167.  And there were those who said, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="168">168.  "If only we had had before us a Message from those of old, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="169">169.  "We should certainly have been Servants of Allah, sincere [and devoted]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="170">170.  But [now that the Qur'an has come], they reject it: But soon will theyknow! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="171">171.  Already has Our Word been passed before [this] to our Servants sent [byUs], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="172">172.  That they would certainly be assisted, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="173">173.  And that Our forces,- they surely must conquer. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="174">174.  So turn thou away from them for a little while, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="175">175.  And watch them [how they fare], and they soon shall see [how thou farest]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="176">176.  Do they wish [indeed] to hurry on our Punishment? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="177">177.  But when it descends into the open space before them, evil will be themorning for those who were warned [and heeded not]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="178">178.  So turn thou away from them for a little while, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="179">179.  And watch [how they fare] and they soon shall see [how thou farest]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="180">180.  Glory to thy Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! [He is free] from whatthey ascribe [to Him]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="181">181.  And Peace on the messengers! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="182">182.  And Praise to Allah, the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds. </p>
