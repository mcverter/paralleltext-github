<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 61. Saff, or Battle Array </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, let it declare the Praises and Gloryof Allah: for He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  O ye who believe! Why say ye that which ye do not? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Grievously odious is it in the sight of Allah that ye say that which ye donot. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Truly Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in battle array, as if theywere a solid cemented structure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And remember, Moses said to his people: "O my people! why do ye vex andinsult me, though ye know that I am the messenger of Allah [sent] to you?" Thenwhen they went wrong, Allah let their hearts go wrong. For Allah guides notthose who are rebellious transgressors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am themessenger of Allah [sent] to you, confirming the Law [which came] before me, andgiving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad."But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, "this is evident sorcery!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Who doth greater wrong than one who invents falsehood against Allah, even ashe is being invited to Islam? And Allah guides not those who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Their intention is to extinguish Allah's Light [by blowing] with theirmouths: But Allah will complete [the revelation of] His Light, even though theUnbelievers may detest [it]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth,that he may proclaim it over all religion, even though the Pagans may detest[it]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  O ye who believe! Shall I lead you to a bargain that will save you from agrievous Penalty?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  That ye believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that ye strive [your utmost]in the Cause of Allah, with your property and your persons: That will be bestfor you, if ye but knew! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  He will forgive you your sins, and admit you to Gardens beneath which Riversflow, and to beautiful mansions in Gardens of Eternity: that is indeed theSupreme Achievement. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And another [favour will He bestow,] which ye do love,- help from Allah anda speedy victory. So give the Glad Tidings to the Believers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of Allah: As said Jesus the son of Mary tothe Disciples, "Who will be my helpers to [the work of] Allah?" Said thedisciples, "We are Allah's helpers!" then a portion of the Children of Israelbelieved, and a portion disbelieved: But We gave power to those who believed,against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed. </p>
