<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 42. Shura, or Consultation </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Ha-Mim </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  'Ain. Sin. Qaf. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Thus doth [He] send inspiration to thee as [He did] to those before thee,-Allah, Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: and He is Most High,Most Great. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  The heavens are almost rent asunder from above them [by Him Glory]: and theangels celebrate the Praises of their Lord, and pray for forgiveness for [all]beings on earth: Behold! Verily Allah is He, the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And those who take as protectors others besides Him,- Allah doth watch overthem; and thou art not the disposer of their affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Qur'an: that thou mayestwarn the Mother of Cities and all around her,- and warn [them] of the Day of </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">Assembly, of which there is no doubt: [when] some will be in the Garden, andsome in the Blazing Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">8.  If Allah had so willed, He could have made them a single people; but Headmits whom He will to His Mercy; and the Wrong-doers will have no protector norhelper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">9.  What! Have they taken [for worship] protectors besides Him? But it is Allah,-He is the Protector, and it is He Who gives life to the dead: It is He Who haspower over all things, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">10.  Whatever it be wherein ye differ, the decision thereof is with Allah: suchis Allah my Lord: In Him I trust, and to Him I turn. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">11.  [He is] the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairsfrom among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiplyyou: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears andsees [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">12.  To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: He enlarges andrestricts. The Sustenance to whom He will: for He knows full well all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">13.  The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined onNoah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which Weenjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfastin religion, and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other thingsthan Allah, hard is the [way] to which thou callest them. Allah chooses toHimself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn [to Him]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">14.  And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- through selfishenvy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth beforefrom thy Lord, [tending] to a Term appointed, the matter would have been settledbetween them: But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are insuspicious [disquieting] doubt concerning it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">15.  Now then, for that [reason], call [them to the Faith], and stand steadfastas thou art commanded, nor follow thou their vain desires; but say: "I believein the Book which Allah has sent down; and I am commanded to judge justlybetween you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord: for us [is the responsibility for]our deeds, and for you for your deeds. There is no contention between us andyou. Allah will bring us together, and to Him is [our] Final Goal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">16.  But those who dispute concerning Allah after He has been accepted,- futileis their dispute in the Sight of their Lord: on them will be a Penalty terrible. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">17.  It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in Truth, and the Balance [by whichto weigh conduct]. And what will make thee realise that perhaps the Hour isclose at hand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">18.  Only those wish to hasten it who believe not in it: those who believe holdit in awe, and know that it is the Truth. Behold, verily those that disputeconcerning the Hour are far astray. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">19.  Gracious is Allah to His servants: He gives Sustenance to whom He pleases:and He has power and can carry out His Will. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">20.  To any that desires the tilth of the Hereafter, We give increase in histilth, and to any that desires the tilth of this world, We grant somewhatthereof, but he has no share or lot in the Hereafter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">21.  What! have they partners [in godhead], who have established for them somereligion without the permission of Allah? Had it not been for the Decree of </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">Judgment, the matter would have been decided between them [at once]. But verilythe Wrong-doers will have a grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">22.  Thou wilt see the Wrong-doers in fear on account of what they have earned,and [the burden of] that must [necessarily] fall on them. But those who believeand work righteous deeds will be in the luxuriant meads of the Gardens: theyshall have, before their Lord, all that they wish for. That will indeed be themagnificent Bounty [of Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">23.  That is [the Bounty] whereof Allah gives Glad Tidings to His Servants whobelieve and do righteous deeds. Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this exceptthe love of those near of kin." And if any one earns any good, We shall give himan increase of good in respect thereof: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Readyto appreciate [service]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">24.  What! Do they say, "He has forged a falsehood against Allah"? But if Allahwilled, He could seal up thy heart. And Allah blots out Vanity, and proves theTruth by His Words. For He knows well the secrets of all hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">25.  He is the One that accepts repentance from His Servants and forgives sins:and He knows all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">26.  And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and givesthem increase of His Bounty: but for the Unbelievers their is a terriblePenalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">27.  If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His Servants, they would indeedtransgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but he sends [it] down in duemeasure as He pleases. For He is with His Servants Well-acquainted, Watchful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">28.  He is the One that sends down rain [even] after [men] have given up allhope, and scatters His Mercy [far and wide]. And He is the Protector, Worthy ofall Praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">29.  And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and theliving creatures that He has scattered through them: and He has power to gatherthem together when He wills. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">30.  Whatever misfortune happens to you, is because on the things your hands havewrought, and for many [of them] He grants forgiveness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">31.  Nor can ye frustrate [aught], [fleeing] through the earth; nor have ye,besides Allah, any one to protect or to help. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">32.  And among His Signs are the ships, smooth-running through the ocean, [tall]as mountains. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">33.  If it be His Will He can still the Wind: then would they become motionlesson the back of the [ocean]. Verily in this are Signs for everyone who patientlyperseveres and is grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">34.  Or He can cause them to perish because of the [evil] which [the men] haveearned; but much doth He forgive. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">35.  But let those know, who dispute about Our Signs, that there is for them noway of escape. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">36.  Whatever ye are given [here] is [but] a convenience of this life: but thatwhich is with Allah is better and more lasting: [it is] for those who believeand put their trust in their Lord: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">37.  Those who avoid the greater crimes and shameful deeds, and, when they areangry even then forgive; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">38.  Those who hearken to their Lord, and establish regular Prayer; who [conduct]their affairs by mutual Consultation; who spend out of what We bestow on themfor Sustenance; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">39.  And those who, when an oppressive wrong is inflicted on them, [are not cowedbut] help and defend themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">40.  The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto [in degree]: but ifa person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah: for[Allah] loveth not those who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">41.  But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong [done] tothem, against such there is no cause of blame. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">42.  The blame is only against those who oppress men and wrong-doing andinsolently transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right and justice:for such there will be a penalty grievous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">43.  But indeed if any show patience and forgive, that would truly be an exerciseof courageous will and resolution in the conduct of affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">44.  For any whom Allah leaves astray, there is no protector thereafter. And thouwilt see the Wrong-doers, when in sight of the Penalty, Say: "Is there any way[to effect] a return?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">45.  And thou wilt see them brought forward to the [Penalty], in a humble frameof mind because of [their] disgrace, [and] looking with a stealthy glance. Andthe Believers will say: "Those are indeed in loss, who have given to perditiontheir own selves and those belonging to them on the Day of Judgment. Behold!Truly the Wrong-doers are in a lasting Penalty!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">46.  And no protectors have they to help them, other than Allah. And for any whomAllah leaves to stray, there is no way [to the Goal]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">47.  Hearken ye to your Lord, before there come a Day which there will be noputting back, because of [the Ordainment of] Allah! that Day there will be foryou no place of refuge nor will there be for you any room for denial [of yoursins]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">48.  If then they run away, We have not sent thee as a guard over them. Thy dutyis but to convey [the Message]. And truly, when We give man a taste of a Mercyfrom Ourselves, he doth exult thereat, but when some ill happens to him, onaccount of the deeds which his hands have sent forth, truly then is manungrateful! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">49.  To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatHe wills [and plans]. He bestows [children] male or female according to His Will[and Plan], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">50.  Or He bestows both males and females, and He leaves barren whom He will: forHe is full of Knowledge and Power. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">51.  It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except byinspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal,with Allah's permission, what Allah wills: for He is Most High, Most Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">52.  And thus have We, by Our Command, sent inspiration to thee: thou knewest not[before] what was Revelation, and what was Faith; but We have made the [Qur'an]a Light, wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will; and verily thoudost guide [men] to the Straight Way,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">53.  The Way of Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever ison earth. Behold [how] all affairs tend towards Allah! </p>
