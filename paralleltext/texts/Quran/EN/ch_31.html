<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 31. Luqman (the Wise) </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Alif, Lam, Mim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  These are Verses of the Wise Book,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  A Guide and a Mercy to the Doers of Good,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Those who establish regular Prayer, and give regular Charity, and have [intheir hearts] the assurance of the Hereafter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  These are on [true] guidance from their Lord: and these are the ones who willprosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  But there are, among men, those who purchase idle tales, without knowledge[or meaning], to mislead [men] from the Path of Allah and throw ridicule [on thePath]: for such there will be a Humiliating Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  When Our Signs are rehearsed to such a one, he turns away in arrogance, as ifhe heard them not, as if there were deafness in both his ears: announce to him agrievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  For those who believe and work righteous deeds, there will be Gardens ofBliss,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  To dwell therein. The promise of Allah is true: and He is Exalted in Power,Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  He created the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; He set on theearth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you; and He scatteredthrough it beasts of all kinds. We send down rain from the sky, and produce onthe earth every kind of noble creature, in pairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Such is the Creation of Allah: now show Me what is there that others besides Him have created: nay, but the Transgressors are in manifest error. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  we bestowed [in the past] Wisdom on Luqman: "Show [thy] gratitude to Allah."Any who is [so] grateful does so to the profit of his own soul: but if any isungrateful, verily Allah is free of all wants, Worthy of all praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Behold, Luqman said to his son by way of instruction: "O my son! join not inworship [others] with Allah: for false worship is indeed the highest wrong­doing." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And We have enjoined on man [to be good] to his parents: in travail upontravail did his mother bear him, and in years twain was his weaning: [hear thecommand], "Show gratitude to Me and to thy parents: to Me is [thy final] Goal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  "But if they strive to make thee join in worship with Me things of whichthou hast no knowledge, obey them not; yet bear them company in this life withjustice [and consideration], and follow the way of those who turn to me [inlove]: in the end the return of you all is to Me, and I will tell you the truth[and meaning] of all that ye did." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  "O my son!" [said Luqman], "If there be [but] the weight of a mustard-seedand it were [hidden] in a rock, or [anywhere] in the heavens or on earth, Allahwill bring it forth: for Allah understands the finest mysteries, [and] is well-acquainted [with them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  "O my son! establish regular prayer, enjoin what is just, and forbid what iswrong: and bear with patient constancy whatever betide thee; for this isfirmness [of purpose] in [the conduct of] affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  "And swell not thy cheek [for pride] at men, nor walk in insolence throughthe earth; for Allah loveth not any arrogant boaster. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  "And be moderate in thy pace, and lower thy voice; for the harshest ofsounds without doubt is the braying of the ass." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Do ye not see that Allah has subjected to your [use] all things in theheavens and on earth, and has made his bounties flow to you in exceedingmeasure, [both] seen and unseen? Yet there are among men those who dispute aboutAllah, without knowledge and without guidance, and without a Book to enlightenthem! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  When they are told to follow the [Revelation] that Allah has sent down, theysay: "Nay, we shall follow the ways that we found our fathers [following]."What! even if it is Satan beckoning them to the Penalty of the [Blazing] Fire? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Whoever submits his whole self to Allah, and is a doer of good, has graspedindeed the most trustworthy hand-hold: and with Allah rests the End and Decisionof [all] affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  But if any reject Faith, let not his rejection grieve thee: to Us is theirreturn, and We shall tell them the truth of their deeds: for Allah knows wellall that is in [men's] hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  We grant them their pleasure for a little while: in the end shall We drivethem to a chastisement unrelenting. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  If thou ask them, who it is that created the heavens and the earth. Theywill certainly say, "Allah". Say: "Praise be to Allah!" But most of themunderstand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  To Allah belong all things in heaven and earth: verily Allah is He [that is]free of all wants, worthy of all praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean [were ink], with sevenoceans behind it to add to its [supply], yet would not the words of Allah beexhausted [in the writing]: for Allah is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  And your creation or your resurrection is in no wise but as an individualsoul: for Allah is He Who hears and sees [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Seest thou not that Allah merges Night into Day and he merges Day intoNight; that He has subjected the sun, and the moon [to his Law], each runningits course for a term appointed; and that Allah is well-acquainted with all thatye do? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  That is because Allah is the [only] Reality, and because whatever else theyinvoke besides Him is Falsehood; and because Allah,- He is the Most High, MostGreat. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Seest thou not that the ships sail through the ocean by the Grace of Allah?-that He may show you of His Signs? Verily in this are Signs for all whoconstantly persevere and give thanks. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  When a wave covers them like the canopy [of clouds], they call to Allah,offering Him sincere devotion. But when He has delivered them safely to land,there are among them those that halt between [right and wrong]. But none rejectOur Signs except only a perfidious ungrateful [wretch]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  O mankind! do your duty to your Lord, and fear [the coming of] a Day when nofather can avail aught for his son, nor a son avail aught for his father.Verily, the promise of Allah is true: let not then this present life deceiveyou, nor let the chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah [alone]. It is He Who sendsdown rain, and He Who knows what is in the wombs. Nor does any one know what itis that he will earn on the morrow: Nor does any one know in what land he is todie. Verily with Allah is full knowledge and He is acquainted [with all things]. </p>
