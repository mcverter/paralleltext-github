<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 8. Anfal, or the Spoils of War </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  They ask thee concerning [things taken as] spoils of war. Say: "[such] spoilsare at the disposal of Allah and the Messenger: So fear Allah, and keep straightthe relations between yourselves: Obey Allah and His Messenger, if ye dobelieve." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  For, Believers are those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a tremor in theirhearts, and when they hear His signs rehearsed, find their faith strengthened,and put [all] their trust in their Lord; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Who establish regular prayers and spend [freely] out of the gifts We havegiven them for sustenance: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Such in truth are the believers: they have grades of dignity with their Lord,and forgiveness, and generous sustenance: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Just as thy Lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth, even though a partyamong the Believers disliked it, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest, as ifthey were being driven to death and they [actually] saw it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Behold! Allah promised you one of the two [enemy] parties, that it should beyours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but Allah willed tojustify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of theUnbelievers;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false, distasteful though itbe to those in guilt. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Remember ye implored the assistance of your Lord, and He answered you: "Iwill assist you with a thousand of the angels, ranks on ranks." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Allah made it but a message of hope, and an assurance to your hearts: [inany case] there is no help except from Allah: and Allah is Exalted in Power,Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness, to give you calm as fromHimself, and he caused rain to descend on you from heaven, to clean youtherewith, to remove from you the stain of Satan, to strengthen your hearts, andto plant your feet firmly therewith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Remember thy Lord inspired the angels [with the message]: "I am with you:give firmness to the Believers: I will instil terror into the hearts of theUnbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips offthem." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger: If any contendagainst Allah and His Messenger, Allah is strict in punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Thus [will it be said]: "Taste ye then of the [punishment]: for those whoresist Allah, is the penalty of the Fire." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array, never turnyour backs to them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagemof war, or to retreat to a troop [of his own]- he draws on himself the wrath ofAllah, and his abode is Hell,- an evil refuge [indeed]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah: when thou threwest [a handful ofdust], it was not thy act, but Allah's: in order that He might test the </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth andknoweth [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">18.  That, and also because Allah is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagemof the Unbelievers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">19.  [O Unbelievers!] if ye prayed for victory and judgment, now hath thejudgment come to you: if ye desist [from wrong], it will be best for you: if yereturn [to the attack], so shall We. Not the least good will your forces be toyou even if they were multiplied: for verily Allah is with those who believe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">20.  O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger, and turn not away from himwhen ye hear [him speak]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">21.  Nor be like those who say, "We hear," but listen not: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">22.  For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and the dumb,-those who understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">23.  If Allah had found in them any good. He would indeed have made them listen:[As it is], if He had made them listen, they would but have turned back anddeclined [Faith]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">24.  O ye who believe! give your response to Allah and His Messenger, when Hecalleth you to that which will give you life; and know that Allah cometh inbetween a man and his heart, and that it is He to Whom ye shall [all] begathered. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">25.  And fear tumult or oppression, which affecteth not in particular [only]those of you who do wrong: and know that Allah is strict in punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">26.  Call to mind when ye were a small [band], despised through the land, andafraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; But He provided a safe asylum foryou, strengthened you with His aid, and gave you Good things for sustenance:that ye might be grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">27.  O ye that believe! betray not the trust of Allah and the Messenger, normisappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">28.  And know ye that your possessions and your progeny are but a trial; and thatit is Allah with Whom lies your highest reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">29.  O ye who believe! if ye fear Allah, He will grant you a criterion [to judgebetween right and wrong], remove from you [all] evil [that may afflict] you, andforgive you: for Allah is the Lord of grace unbounded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">30.  Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee, to keep thee in bonds, orslay thee, or get thee out [of thy home]. They plot and plan, and Allah tooplans; but the best of planners is Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">31.  When Our Signs are rehearsed to them, they say: "We have heard this[before]: if we wished, we could say [words] like these: these are nothing buttales of the ancients." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">32.  Remember how they said: "O Allah if this is indeed the Truth from Thee, raindown on us a shower of stones form the sky, or send us a grievous penalty." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">33.  But Allah was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongstthem; nor was He going to send it whilst they could ask for pardon. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">34.  But what plea have they that Allah should not punish them, when they keepout [men] from the sacred Mosque - and they are not its guardians? No men can beits guardians except the righteous; but most of them do not understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">35.  Their prayer at the House [of Allah] is nothing but whistling and clappingof hands: [Its only answer can be], "Taste ye the penalty because yeblasphemed." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">36.  The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder [man] from the path of Allah,and so will they continue to spend; but in the end they will have [only] regretsand sighs; at length they will be overcome: and the Unbelievers will be gatheredtogether to Hell;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">37.  In order that Allah may separate the impure from the pure, put the impure,one on another, heap them together, and cast them into Hell. They will be theones to have lost. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">38.  Say to the Unbelievers, if [now] they desist [from Unbelief], their pastwould be forgiven them; but if they persist, the punishment of those before themis already [a matter of warning for them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">39.  And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and thereprevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease,verily Allah doth see all that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">40.  If they refuse, be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protectand the best to help. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">41.  And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire [in war], a fifthshare is assigned to Allah,- and to the Messenger, and to near relatives,orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in Allah and in therevelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing,- the Day of themeeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">42.  Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley, and they on the fartherside, and the caravan on lower ground than ye. Even if ye had made a mutualappointment to meet, ye would certainly have failed in the appointment: But[thus ye met], that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted; that thosewho died might die after a clear Sign [had been given], and those who livedmight live after a Clear Sign [had been given]. And verily Allah is He Whoheareth and knoweth [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">43.  Remember in thy dream Allah showed them to thee as few: if He had shown themto thee as many, ye would surely have been discouraged, and ye would surely havedisputed in [your] decision; but Allah saved [you]: for He knoweth well the[secrets] of [all] hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">44.  And remember when ye met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes, and Hemade you appear as contemptible in their eyes: that Allah might accomplish amatter already enacted. For to Allah do all questions go back [for decision]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">45.  O ye who believe! When ye meet a force, be firm, and call Allah inremembrance much [and often]; that ye may prosper: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">46.  And obey Allah and His Messenger; and fall into no disputes, lest ye loseheart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For Allah is withthose who patiently persevere: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">47.  And be not like those who started from their homes insolently and to be seenof men, and to hinder [men] from the path of Allah: For Allah compasseth roundabout all that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">48.  Remember Satan made their [sinful] acts seem alluring to them, and said: "Noone among men can overcome you this day, while I am near to you": But when thetwo forces came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels, and said: "Lo! Iam clear of you; lo! I see what ye see not; Lo! I fear Allah: for Allah isstrict in punishment." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">49.  Lo! the hypocrites say, and those in whose hearts is a disease: "Thesepeople,- their religion has misled them." But if any trust in Allah, behold!Allah is Exalted in might, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">50.  If thou couldst see, when the angels take the souls of the Unbelievers [atdeath], [How] they smite their faces and their backs, [saying]: "Taste thepenalty of the blazing Fire-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">51.  "Because of [the deeds] which your [own] hands sent forth; for Allah isnever unjust to His servants: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">52.  "[Deeds] after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them:They rejected the Signs of Allah, and Allah punished them for their crimes: forAllah is Strong, and Strict in punishment: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">53.  "Because Allah will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on apeople until they change what is in their [own] souls: and verily Allah is HeWho heareth and knoweth [all things]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">54.  [Deeds] after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them":They treated as false the Signs of their Lord: so We destroyed them for theircrimes, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh: for they were all oppressors andwrong-doers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">55.  For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who reject Him: Theywill not believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">56.  They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant, but they break theircovenant every time, and they have not the fear [of Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">57.  If ye gain the mastery over them in war, disperse, with them, those whofollow them, that they may remember. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">58.  If thou fearest treachery from any group, throw back [their covenant] tothem, [so as to be] on equal terms: for Allah loveth not the treacherous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">59.  Let not the unbelievers think that they can get the better [of the godly]:they will never frustrate [them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">60.  Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, includingsteeds of war, to strike terror into [the hearts of] the enemies, of Allah andyour enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom Allah dothknow. Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of Allah, shall be repaid unto you,and ye shall not be treated unjustly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">61.  But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou [also] incline towardspeace, and trust in Allah: for He is One that heareth and knoweth [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">62.  Should they intend to deceive thee,- verily Allah sufficeth thee: He it isThat hath strengthened thee with His aid and with [the company of] theBelievers; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">63.  And [moreover] He hath put affection between their hearts: not if thou hadstspent all that is in the earth, couldst thou have produced that affection, butAllah hath done it: for He is Exalted in might, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">64.  O Prophet! sufficient unto thee is Allah,- [unto thee] and unto those whofollow thee among the Believers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">65.  O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongstyou, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred, theywill vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are a people withoutunderstanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">66.  For the present, Allah hath lightened your [task], for He knoweth that thereis a weak spot in you: But [even so], if there are a hundred of you, patient andpersevering, they will vanquish two hundred, and if a thousand, they willvanquish two thousand, with the leave of Allah: for Allah is with those whopatiently persevere. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">67.  It is not fitting for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war untilhe hath thoroughly subdued the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of thisworld; but Allah looketh to the Hereafter: And Allah is Exalted in might, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">68.  Had it not been for a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe penalty wouldhave reached you for the [ransom] that ye took. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">69.  But [now] enjoy what ye took in war, lawful and good: but fear Allah: forAllah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">70.  O Prophet! say to those who are captives in your hands: "If Allah findethany good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has beentaken from you, and He will forgive you: for Allah is Oft- forgiving, MostMerciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">71.  But if they have treacherous designs against thee, [O Messenger!], they havealready been in treason against Allah, and so hath He given [thee] power overthem. And Allah so He Who hath [full] knowledge and wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">72.  Those who believed, and adopted exile, and fought for the Faith, with theirproperty and their persons, in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave[them] asylum and aid,- these are [all] friends and protectors, one of another.As to those who believed but came not into exile, ye owe no duty of protectionto them until they come into exile; but if they seek your aid in religion, it isyour duty to help them, except against a people with whom ye have a treaty ofmutual alliance. And [remember] Allah seeth all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">73.  The Unbelievers are protectors, one of another: Unless ye do this, [protecteach other], there would be tumult and oppression on earth, and great mischief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">74.  Those who believe, and adopt exile, and fight for the Faith, in the cause ofAllah as well as those who give [them] asylum and aid,- these are [all] in verytruth the Believers: for them is the forgiveness of sins and a provision mostgenerous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">75.  And those who accept Faith subsequently, and adopt exile, and fight for theFaith in your company,- they are of you. But kindred by blood have prior rightsagainst each other in the Book of Allah. Verily Allah is well-acquainted withall things. </p>
