<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 12. YUSUF, or Joseph </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  A. L. R. These are the symbols [or Verses] of the perspicuous Book. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an, in order that ye may learn wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  We do relate unto thee the most beautiful of stories, in that We reveal tothee this [portion of the] Qur'an: before this, thou too was among those whoknew it not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Behold! Joseph said to his father: "O my father! I did see eleven stars andthe sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Said [the father]: "My [dear] little son! relate not thy vision to thybrothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is to man an avowedenemy! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  "Thus will thy Lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of stories[and events] and perfect His favour to thee and to the posterity of Jacob - evenas He perfected it to thy fathers Abraham and Isaac aforetime! for Allah is fullof knowledge and wisdom." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs [or symbols] for seekers [afterTruth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  They said: "Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father thanwe: But we are a goodly body! really our father is obviously wandering [in hismind]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  "Slay ye Joseph or cast him out to some [unknown] land, that so the favour ofyour father may be given to you alone: [there will be time enough] for you to berighteous after that!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Said one of them: "Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw himdown to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan oftravellers." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  They said: "O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Joseph,- seeing weare indeed his sincere well-wishers? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  "Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall takeevery care of him." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  [Jacob] said: "Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fearlest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  They said: "If the wolf were to devour him while we are [so large] a party,then should we indeed [first] have perished ourselves!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to thebottom of the well: and We put into his heart [this Message]: 'Of a surety thoushalt [one day] tell them the truth of this their affair while they know [thee]not' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  They said: "O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Josephwith our things; and the wolf devoured him ... But thou wilt never believe useven though we tell the truth." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: "Nay, but your minds havemade up a tale [that may pass] with you, [for me] patience is most fitting:Against that which ye assert, it is Allah [alone] Whose help can be sought".. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Then there came a caravan of travellers: they sent their water-carrier [forwater], and he let down his bucket [into the well] ... He said: "Ah there! Goodnews! Here is a [fine] young man!" So they concealed him as a treasure! ButAllah knoweth well all that they do! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  The [Brethren] sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams countedout: in such low estimation did they hold him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: "Make his stay [among us]honourable: may be he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son."Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him theinterpretation of stories [and events]. And Allah hath full power and controlover His affairs; but most among mankind know it not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  When Joseph attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thusdo We reward those who do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his [true] self:she fastened the doors, and said: "Now come, thou [dear one]!" He said: "Allahforbid! truly [thy husband] is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly tono good come those who do wrong!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  And [with passion] did she desire him, and he would have desired her, butthat he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus [did We order] that We might turnaway from him [all] evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants,sincere and purified. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from theback: they both found her lord near the door. She said: "What is the [fitting]punishment for one who formed an evil design against thy wife, but prison or agrievous chastisement?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  He said: "It was she that sought to seduce me - from my [true] self." Andone of her household saw [this] and bore witness, [thus]:- "If it be that hisshirt is rent from the front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then is she the liar,and he is telling the truth!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  So when he saw his shirt,- that it was torn at the back,- [her husband]said: "Behold! It is a snare of you women! truly, mighty is your snare! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "O Joseph, pass this over! [O wife], ask forgiveness for thy sin, for trulythou hast been at fault!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Ladies said in the City: "The wife of the [great] 'Aziz is seeking to seduceher slave from his [true] self: Truly hath he inspired her with violent love: wesee she is evidently going astray." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  When she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and prepared abanquet for them: she gave each of them a knife: and she said [to Joseph], "Comeout before them." When they saw him, they did extol him, and [in theiramazement] cut their hands: they said, "Allah preserve us! no mortal is this!this is none other than a noble angel!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  She said: "There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me! I didseek to seduce him from his [true] self but he did firmly save himselfguiltless! ... and now, if he doth not my bidding, he shall certainly be castinto prison, and [what is more] be of the company of the vilest!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  He said: "O my Lord! the prison is more to my liking than that to which theyinvite me: Unless Thou turn away their snare from me, I should [in my youthfulfolly] feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  So his Lord hearkened to him [in his prayer], and turned away from him theirsnare: Verily He heareth and knoweth [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Then it occurred to the men, after they had seen the signs, [that it wasbest] to imprison him for a time. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Now with him there came into the prison two young men. Said one of them: "Isee myself [in a dream] pressing wine." said the other: "I see myself [in adream] carrying bread on my head, and birds are eating, thereof." "Tell us"[they said] "The truth and meaning thereof: for we see thou art one that dothgood [to all]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  He said: "Before any food comes [in due course] to feed either of you, Iwill surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: thatis part of the [duty] which my Lord hath taught me. I have [I assure you]abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in Allah and that [even] denythe Hereafter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  "And I follow the ways of my fathers,- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and nevercould we attribute any partners whatever to Allah: that [comes] of the grace ofAllah to us and to mankind: yet most men are not grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  "O my two companions of the prison! [I ask you]: are many lords differingamong themselves better, or the One Allah, Supreme and Irresistible? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  "If not Him, ye worship nothing but names which ye have named,- ye and yourfathers,- for which Allah hath sent down no authority: the command is for nonebut Allah: He hath commanded that ye worship none but Him: that is the rightreligion, but most men understand not.... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  "O my two companions of the prison! As to one of you, he will pour out thewine for his lord to drink: as for the other, he will hang from the cross, andthe birds will eat from off his head. [so] hath been decreed that matter whereofye twain do enquire".... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  And of the two, to that one whom he consider about to be saved, he said:"Mention me to thy lord." But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord:and [Joseph] lingered in prison a few [more] years. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  The king [of Egypt] said: "I do see [in a vision] seven fat kine, whom sevenlean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven [others] withered. Oye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  They said: "A confused medley of dreams: and we are not skilled in theinterpretation of dreams." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  But the man who had been released, one of the two [who had been in prison]and who now bethought him after [so long] a space of time, said: "I will tellyou the truth of its interpretation: send ye me [therefore]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  "O Joseph!" [he said] "O man of truth! Expound to us [the dream] of sevenfat kine whom seven lean ones devour, and of seven green ears of corn and[seven] others withered: that I may return to the people, and that they mayunderstand." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  [Joseph] said: "For seven years shall ye diligently sow as is your wont: andthe harvests that ye reap, ye shall leave them in the ear,- except a little, ofwhich ye shall eat. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  "Then will come after that [period] seven dreadful [years], which willdevour what ye shall have laid by in advance for them,- [all] except a littlewhich ye shall have [specially] guarded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  "Then will come after that [period] a year in which the people will haveabundant water, and in which they will press [wine and oil]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  So the king said: "Bring ye him unto me." But when the messenger came tohim, [Joseph] said: "Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, 'What is the stateof mind of the ladies who cut their hands'? For my Lord is certainly well awareof their snare." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  [The king] said [to the ladies]: "What was your affair when ye did seek toseduce Joseph from his [true] self?" The ladies said: "Allah preserve us! noevil know we against him!" Said the 'Aziz's wife: "Now is the truth manifest [toall]: it was I who sought to seduce him from his [true] self: He is indeed ofthose who are [ever] true [and virtuous]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  "This [say I], in order that He may know that I have never been false to himin his absence, and that Allah will never guide the snare of the false ones. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  "Nor do I absolve my own self [of blame]: the [human] soul is certainlyprone to evil, unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy: but surely my Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  So the king said: "Bring him unto me; I will take him specially to serveabout my own person." Therefore when he had spoken to him, he said: "Be assuredthis day, thou art, before our own presence, with rank firmly established, andfidelity fully proved! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  [Joseph] said: "Set me over the store-houses of the land: I will indeedguard them, as one that knows [their importance]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  Thus did We give established power to Joseph in the land, to take possessiontherein as, when, or where he pleased. We bestow of our Mercy on whom We please,and We suffer not, to be lost, the reward of those who do good. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best, for those who believe,and are constant in righteousness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  Then came Joseph's brethren: they entered his presence, and he knew them,but they knew him not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  And when he had furnished them forth with provisions [suitable] for them, hesaid: "Bring unto me a brother ye have, of the same father as yourselves, [but adifferent mother]: see ye not that I pay out full measure, and that I do providethe best hospitality? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  "Now if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure [of corn] from me,nor shall ye [even] come near me." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  They said: "We shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from hisfather: Indeed we shall do it." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  And [Joseph] told his servants to put their stock-in-trade [with which theyhad bartered] into their saddle-bags, so they should know it only when theyreturned to their people, in order that they might come back. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  Now when they returned to their father, they said: "O our father! No moremeasure of grain shall we get [unless we take our brother]: So send our brotherwith us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care ofhim." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  He said: "Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when Itrusted you with his brother aforetime? But Allah is the best to take care [ofhim], and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  Then when they opened their baggage, they found their stock-in-trade hadbeen returned to them. They said: "O our father! What [more] can we desire? thisour stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get [more] food for ourfamily; We shall take care of our brother; and add [at the same time] a fullcamel's load [of grain to our provisions]. This is but a small quantity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  [Jacob] said: "Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oathto me, in Allah's name, that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless yeare yourselves hemmed in [and made powerless]. And when they had sworn theirsolemn oath, he said: "Over all that we say, be Allah the witness and guardian!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  Further he said: "O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye bydifferent gates. Not that I can profit you aught against Allah [with my advice]:None can command except Allah: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trustput their trust on Him." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did notprofit them in the least against [the plan of] Allah: It was but a necessity ofJacob's soul, which he discharged. For he was, by our instruction, full ofknowledge [and experience]: but most men know not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  Now when they came into Joseph's presence, he received his [full] brother tostay with him. He said [to him]: "Behold! I am thy [own] brother; so grieve notat aught of their doings." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions [suitable] forthem, he put the drinking cup into his brother's saddle-bag. Then shouted out acrier: "O ye [in] the caravan! behold! ye are thieves, without doubt!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  They said, turning towards them: "What is it that ye miss?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  They said: "We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it,is [the reward of] a camel load; I will be bound by it." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  [The brothers] said: "By Allah! well ye know that we came not to makemischief in the land, and we are no thieves!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  [The Egyptians] said: "What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are[proved] to have lied?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  They said: "The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found,should be held [as bondman] to atone for the [crime]. Thus it is we punish thewrong-doers!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  So he began [the search] with their baggage, before [he came to] the baggageof his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother's baggage. Thus didWe plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king exceptthat Allah willed it [so]. We raise to degrees [of wisdom] whom We please: butover all endued with knowledge is one, the All-Knowing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  They said: "If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before[him]." But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not thesecrets to them. He [simply] said [to himself]: "Ye are the worse situated; andAllah knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  They said: "O exalted one! Behold! he has a father, aged and venerable, [whowill grieve for him]; so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art[gracious] in doing good." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  He said: "Allah forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed [if we did so], we should be acting wrongfully. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  Now when they saw no hope of his [yielding], they held a conference inprivate. The leader among them said: "Know ye not that your father did take anoath from you in Allah's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your dutywith Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me, orAllah commands me; and He is the best to command. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  "Turn ye back to your father, and say, 'O our father! behold! thy soncommitted theft! we bear witness only to what we know, and we could not wellguard against the unseen! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  "'Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned,and [you will find] we are indeed telling the truth.'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  Jacob said: "Nay, but ye have yourselves contrived a story [good enough] foryou. So patience is most fitting [for me]. Maybe Allah will bring them [back]all to me [in the end]. For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  And he turned away from them, and said: "How great is my grief for Joseph!"And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  They said: "By Allah! [never] wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thoureach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  He said: "I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allah, and I knowfrom Allah that which ye know not.... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  "O my sons! go ye and enquire about Joseph and his brother, and never giveup hope of Allah's Soothing Mercy: truly no one despairs of Allah's SoothingMercy, except those who have no faith." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  Then, when they came [back] into [Joseph's] presence they said: "O exaltedone! distress has seized us and our family: we have [now] brought but scantycapital: so pay us full measure, [we pray thee], and treat it as charity to us:for Allah doth reward the charitable." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  He said: "Know ye how ye dealt with Joseph and his brother, not knowing[what ye were doing]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  They said: "Art thou indeed Joseph?" He said, "I am Joseph, and this is mybrother: Allah has indeed been gracious to us [all]: behold, he that isrighteous and patient,- never will Allah suffer the reward to be lost, of thosewho do right." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  They said: "By Allah! indeed has Allah preferred thee above us, and wecertainly have been guilty of sin!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  He said: "This day let no reproach be [cast] on you: Allah will forgive you,and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  "Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father: he will cometo see [clearly]. Then come ye [here] to me together with all your family." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  When the caravan left [Egypt], their father said: "I do indeed scent thepresence of Joseph: Nay, think me not a dotard." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  They said: "By Allah! truly thou art in thine old wandering mind." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  Then when the bearer of the good news came, He cast [the shirt] over hisface, and he forthwith regained clear sight. He said: "Did I not say to you, 'Iknow from Allah that which ye know not?'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">97.  They said: "O our father! ask for us forgiveness for our sins, for we weretruly at fault." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">98.  He said: "Soon will I ask my Lord for forgiveness for you: for he is indeedOft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">99.  Then when they entered the presence of Joseph, he provided a home for hisparents with himself, and said: "Enter ye Egypt [all] in safety if it pleaseAllah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">100.  And he raised his parents high on the throne [of dignity], and they felldown in prostration, [all] before him. He said: "O my father! this is thefulfilment of my vision of old! Allah hath made it come true! He was indeed goodto me when He took me out of prison and brought you [all here] out of thedesert, [even] after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Verily myLord understandeth best the mysteries of all that He planneth to do, for verilyHe is full of knowledge and wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">101.  "O my Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on me some power, and taught mesomething of the interpretation of dreams and events,- O Thou Creator of theheavens and the earth! Thou art my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter.Take Thou my soul [at death] as one submitting to Thy will [as a Muslim], andunite me with the righteous." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">102.  Such is one of the stories of what happened unseen, which We reveal byinspiration unto thee; nor wast thou [present] with them then when theyconcerted their plans together in the process of weaving their plots. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">103.  Yet no faith will the greater part of mankind have, however ardently thoudost desire it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">104.  And no reward dost thou ask of them for this: it is no less than a messagefor all creatures. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">105.  And how many Signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by? Yet theyturn [their faces] away from them! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">106.  And most of them believe not in Allah without associating [other aspartners] with Him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">107.  Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veilof the wrath of Allah,- or of the coming against them of the [final] Hour all ofa sudden while they perceive not? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">108.  Say thou: "This is my way: I do invite unto Allah,- on evidence clear asthe seeing with one's eyes,- I and whoever follows me. Glory to Allah! and neverwill I join gods with Allah!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">109.  Nor did We send before thee [as messengers] any but men, whom we didinspire,- [men] living in human habitations. Do they not travel through the </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">earth, and see what was the end of those before them? But the home of thehereafter is best, for those who do right. Will ye not then understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">110.  [Respite will be granted] until, when the messengers give up hope [of theirpeople] and [come to] think that they were treated as liars, there reaches themOur help, and those whom We will are delivered into safety. But never will bewarded off our punishment from those who are in sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">111.  There is, in their stories, instruction for men endued with understanding.It is not a tale invented, but a confirmation of what went before it,- adetailed exposition of all things, and a guide and a mercy to any such asbelieve. </p>
