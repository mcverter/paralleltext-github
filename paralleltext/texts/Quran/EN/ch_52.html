<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  By the Mount [of Revelation]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  By a Decree inscribed </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  In a Scroll unfolded; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  By the much-frequented Fane; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  By the Canopy Raised High; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And by the Ocean filled with Swell;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Verily, the Doom of thy Lord will indeed come to pass;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  There is none can avert it;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  On the Day when the firmament will be in dreadful commotion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And the mountains will fly hither and thither. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Then woe that Day to those that treat [Truth] as Falsehood;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  That play [and paddle] in shallow trifles. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  That Day shall they be thrust down to the Fire of Hell, irresistibly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  "This:, it will be said, "Is the Fire,- which ye were wont to deny! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  "Is this then a fake, or is it ye that do not see? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  "Burn ye therein: the same is it to you whether ye bear it with patience, ornot: Ye but receive the recompense of your [own] deeds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  As to the Righteous, they will be in Gardens, and in Happiness,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Enjoying the [Bliss] which their Lord hath bestowed on them, and their Lordshall deliver them from the Penalty of the Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  [To them will be said:] "Eat and drink ye, with profit and health, becauseof your [good] deeds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  They will recline [with ease] on Thrones [of dignity] arranged in ranks; andWe shall join them to Companions, with beautiful big and lustrous eyes. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And those who believe and whose families follow them in Faith,- to themshall We join their families: Nor shall We deprive them [of the fruit] of aughtof their works: [Yet] is each individual in pledge for his deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  And We shall bestow on them, of fruit and meat, anything they shall desire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  They shall there exchange, one with another, a [loving] cup free offrivolity, free of all taint of ill. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Round about them will serve, [devoted] to them, young male servants[handsome] as Pearls well-guarded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  They will advance to each other, engaging in mutual enquiry. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  They will say: "Aforetime, we were not without fear for the sake of ourpeople. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "But Allah has been good to us, and has delivered us from the Penalty of theScorching Wind. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  "Truly, we did call unto Him from of old: truly it is He, the Beneficent,the Merciful!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Therefore proclaim thou the praises [of thy Lord]: for by the Grace of thyLord, thou art no [vulgar] soothsayer, nor art thou one possessed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Or do they say:- "A Poet! we await for him some calamity [hatched] by Time!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Say thou: "Await ye!- I too will wait along with you!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Is it that their faculties of understanding urge them to this, or are theybut a people transgressing beyond bounds? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Or do they say, "He fabricated the [Message]"? Nay, they have no faith! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Let them then produce a recital like unto it,- If [it be] they speak thetruth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Were they created of nothing, or were they themselves the creators? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, they have no firm belief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Or are the Treasures of thy Lord with them, or are they the managers [ofaffairs]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Or have they a ladder, by which they can [climb up to heaven and] listen [toits secrets]? Then let [such a] listener of theirs produce a manifest proof. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  Or has He only daughters and ye have sons? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Or is it that thou dost ask for a reward, so that they are burdened with aload of debt?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Or that the Unseen in it their hands, and they write it down? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Or do they intend a plot [against thee]? But those who defy Allah arethemselves involved in a Plot! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  Or have they a god other than Allah? Exalted is Allah far above the thingsthey associate with Him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Were they to see a piece of the sky falling [on them], they would [only]say: "Clouds gathered in heaps!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs, wherein theyshall [perforce] swoon [with terror],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  The Day when their plotting will avail them nothing and no help shall begiven them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment besidesthis: But most of them understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  Now await in patience the command of thy Lord: for verily thou art in Oureyes: and celebrate the praises of thy Lord the while thou standest forth, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  And for part of the night also praise thou Him,- and at the retreat of thestars! </p>
