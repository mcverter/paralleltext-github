<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 58. Mujadila, or The Woman who Pleads </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Allah has indeed heard [and accepted] the statement of the woman who pleadswith thee concerning her husband and carries her complaint [in prayer] to Allah:and Allah [always] hears the arguments between both sides among you: for Allahhears and sees [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  If any men among you divorce their wives by Zihar [calling them mothers],they cannot be their mothers: None can be their mothers except those who gavethem birth. And in fact they use words [both] iniquitous and false: but trulyAllah is one that blots out [sins], and forgives [again and again]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  But those who divorce their wives by Zihar, then wish to go back on the wordsthey uttered,- [It is ordained that such a one] should free a slave before theytouch each other: Thus are ye admonished to perform: and Allah is well-acquainted with [all] that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And if any has not [the wherewithal], he should fast for two monthsconsecutively before they touch each other. But if any is unable to do so, heshould feed sixty indigent ones, this, that ye may show your faith in Allah andHis Messenger. Those are limits [set by] Allah. For those who reject [Him],there is a grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be humbled to dust, as werethose before them: for We have already sent down Clear Signs. And theUnbelievers [will have] a humiliating Penalty,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  On the Day that Allah will raise them all up [again] and show them the Truth[and meaning] of their conduct. Allah has reckoned its [value], though they mayhave forgotten it, for Allah is Witness to all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Seest thou not that Allah doth know [all] that is in the heavens and onearth? There is not a secret consultation between three, but He makes the fourthamong them, - Nor between five but He makes the sixth,- nor between fewer normore, but He is in their midst, wheresoever they be: In the end will He tellthem the truth of their conduct, on the Day of Judgment. For Allah has fullknowledge of all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Turnest thou not thy sight towards those who were forbidden secret counselsyet revert to that which they were forbidden [to do]? And they hold secretcounsels among themselves for iniquity and hostility, and disobedience to theMessenger. And when they come to thee, they salute thee, not as Allah salutesthee, [but in crooked ways]: And they say to themselves, "Why does not Allahpunish us for our words?" Enough for them is Hell: In it will they burn, andevil is that destination! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  O ye who believe! When ye hold secret counsel, do it not for iniquity andhostility, and disobedience to the Prophet; but do it for righteousness andself-restraint; and fear Allah, to Whom ye shall be brought back. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Secret counsels are only [inspired] by the Evil One, in order that he maycause grief to the Believers; but he cannot harm them in the least, except asAllah permits; and on Allah let the Believers put their trust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  O ye who believe! When ye are told to make room in the assemblies, [spreadout and] make room: [ample] room will Allah provide for you. And when ye aretold to rise up, rise up Allah will rise up, to [suitable] ranks [and degrees],those of you who believe and who have been granted [mystic] Knowledge. And Allahis well-acquainted with all ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  O ye who believe! When ye consult the Messenger in private, spend somethingin charity before your private consultation. That will be best for you, and mostconducive to purity [of conduct]. But if ye find not [the wherewithal], Allah isOft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Is it that ye are afraid of spending sums in charity before your privateconsultation [with him]? If, then, ye do not so, and Allah forgives you, then[at least] establish regular prayer; practise regular charity; and obey Allahand His Messenger. And Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Turnest thou not thy attention to those who turn [in friendship] to such ashave the Wrath of Allah upon them? They are neither of you nor of them, and theyswear to falsehood knowingly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Allah has prepared for them a severe Penalty: evil indeed are their deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  They have made their oaths a screen [for their misdeeds]: thus they obstruct[men] from the Path of Allah: therefore shall they have a humiliating Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Of no profit whatever to them, against Allah, will be their riches nor theirsons: they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein [for aye]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  One day will Allah raise them all up [for Judgment]: then will they swear toHim as they swear to you: And they think that they have something [to standupon]. No, indeed! they are but liars! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  The Evil One has got the better of them: so he has made them lose theremembrance of Allah. They are the Party of the Evil One. Truly, it is the Partyof the Evil One that will perish! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among those mosthumiliated. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Allah has decreed: "It is I and My messengers who must prevail": For Allahis One full of strength, able to enforce His Will. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, lovingthose who resist Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their fathers ortheir sons, or their brothers, or their kindred. For such He has written Faithin their hearts, and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself. And He willadmit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, to dwell therein [for ever].Allah will be well pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party ofAllah. Truly it is the Party of Allah that will achieve Felicity. </p>
