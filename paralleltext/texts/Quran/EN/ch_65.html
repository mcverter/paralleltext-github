<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 65. Talaq, or Divorce </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  O Prophet! When ye do divorce women, divorce them at their prescribedperiods, and count [accurately], their prescribed periods: And fear Allah yourLord: and turn them not out of their houses, nor shall they [themselves] leave,except in case they are guilty of some open lewdness, those are limits set byAllah: and any who transgresses the limits of Allah, does verily wrong his [own]soul: thou knowest not if perchance Allah will bring about thereafter some newsituation. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Thus when they fulfil their term appointed, either take them back onequitable terms or part with them on equitable terms; and take for witness twopersons from among you, endued with justice, and establish the evidence [as]before Allah. Such is the admonition given to him who believes in Allah and theLast Day. And for those who fear Allah, He [ever] prepares a way out, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And He provides for him from [sources] he never could imagine. And if any oneputs his trust in Allah, sufficient is [Allah] for him. For Allah will surelyaccomplish his purpose: verily, for all things has Allah appointed a dueproportion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Such of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them theprescribed period, if ye have any doubts, is three months, and for those whohave no courses [it is the same]: for those who carry [life within their wombs],their period is until they deliver their burdens: and for those who fear Allah,He will make their path easy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  That is the Command of Allah, which He has sent down to you: and if any onefears Allah, He will remove his ills, from him, and will enlarge his reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Let the women live [in 'iddat] in the same style as ye live, according toyour means: Annoy them not, so as to restrict them. And if they carry [life intheir wombs], then spend [your substance] on them until they deliver theirburden: and if they suckle your [offspring], give them their recompense: andtake mutual counsel together, according to what is just and reasonable. And ifye find yourselves in difficulties, let another woman suckle [the child] on the[father's] behalf. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Let the man of means spend according to his means: and the man whoseresources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him.Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. After adifficulty, Allah will soon grant relief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  How many populations that insolently opposed the Command of their Lord and ofHis messengers, did We not then call to account,- to severe account?- and Weimposed on them an exemplary Punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Then did they taste the evil result of their conduct, and the End of theirconduct was Perdition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Allah has prepared for them a severe Punishment [in the Hereafter].Therefore fear Allah, O ye men of understanding - who have believed!- for Allahhath indeed sent down to you a Message,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  An Messenger, who rehearses to you the Signs of Allah containing clearexplanations, that he may lead forth those who believe and do righteous deedsfrom the depths of Darkness into Light. And those who believe in Allah and workrighteousness, He will admit to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, to dwelltherein for ever: Allah has indeed granted for them a most excellent Provision. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Allah is He Who created seven Firmaments and of the earth a similar number. Through the midst of them [all] descends His Command: that ye may know thatAllah has power over all things, and that Allah comprehends, all things in [His]Knowledge. </p>
