<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 23. Muminun, or The Believers </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  The believers must [eventually] win through,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Those who humble themselves in their prayers; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Who avoid vain talk; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Who are active in deeds of charity; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Who abstain from sex, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or [the captives] whomtheir right hands possess,- for [in their case] they are free from blame, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  But those whose desires exceed those limits are transgressors;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Those who faithfully observe their trusts and their covenants; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And who [strictly] guard their prayers;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  These will be the heirs, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Who will inherit Paradise: they will dwell therein [for ever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Man We did create from a quintessence [of clay]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Then We placed him as [a drop of] sperm in a place of rest, firmly fixed; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood; then of that clot Wemade a [foetus] lump; then we made out of that lump bones and clothed the boneswith flesh; then we developed out of it another creature. So blessed be Allah,the best to create! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  After that, at length ye will die </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Again, on the Day of Judgment, will ye be raised up. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  And We have made, above you, seven tracts; and We are never unmindful of[our] Creation. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  And We send down water from the sky according to [due] measure, and We causeit to soak in the soil; and We certainly are able to drain it off [with ease]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  With it We grow for you gardens of date-palms and vines: in them have yeabundant fruits: and of them ye eat [and have enjoyment],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Also a tree springing out of Mount Sinai, which produces oil, and relish forthose who use it for food. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And in cattle [too] ye have an instructive example: from within their bodiesWe produce [milk] for you to drink; there are, in them, [besides], numerous[other] benefits for you; and of their [meat] ye eat; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  An on them, as well as in slips, ye side. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  [Further, We sent a long line of prophets for your instruction]. We sentNoah to his people: He said, "O my people! worship Allah! Ye have no other godbut Him. Will ye not fear [Him]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  The chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: "He is no more than aman like yourselves: his wish is to assert his superiority over you: if Allahhad wished [to send messengers], He could have sent down angels; never did wehear such a thing [as he says], among our ancestors of old." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  [And some said]: "He is only a man possessed: wait [and have patience] withhim for a time." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  [Noah] said: "O my Lord! help me: for that they accuse me of falsehood!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  So We inspired him [with this message]: "Construct the Ark within Our sightand under Our guidance: then when comes Our Command, and the fountains of theearth gush forth, take thou on board pairs of every species, male and female,and thy family- except those of them against whom the Word has already goneforth: And address Me not in favour of the wrong-doers; for they shall bedrowned [in the Flood]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  And when thou hast embarked on the Ark - thou and those with thee,- say:"Praise be to Allah, Who has saved us from the people who do wrong." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  And say: "O my Lord! enable me to disembark with thy blessing: for Thou artthe Best to enable [us] to disembark." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Verily in this there are Signs [for men to understand]; [thus] do We try[men]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Then We raised after them another generation. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And We sent to them a messenger from among themselves, [saying], "WorshipAllah! ye have no other god but Him. Will ye not fear [Him]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  And the chiefs of his people, who disbelieved and denied the Meeting in theHereafter, and on whom We had bestowed the good things of this life, said: "Heis no more than a man like yourselves: he eats of that of which ye eat, anddrinks of what ye drink. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  "If ye obey a man like yourselves, behold, it is certain ye will be lost. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  "Does he promise that when ye die and become dust and bones, ye shall bebrought forth [again]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  "Far, very far is that which ye are promised! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  "There is nothing but our life in this world! We shall die and we live! Butwe shall never be raised up again! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  "He is only a man who invents a lie against Allah, but we are not the onesto believe in him!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  [The prophet] said: "O my Lord! help me: for that they accuse me offalsehood." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  [Allah] said: "In but a little while, they are sure to be sorry!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Then the Blast overtook them with justice, and We made them as rubbish ofdead leaves [floating on the stream of Time]! So away with the people who dowrong! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Then We raised after them other generations. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  No people can hasten their term, nor can they delay [it]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Then sent We our messengers in succession: every time there came to a peopletheir messenger, they accused him of falsehood: so We made them follow eachother [in punishment]: We made them as a tale [that is told]: So away with apeople that will not believe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our Signs and authoritymanifest, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  To Pharaoh and his Chiefs: But these behaved insolently: they were anarrogant people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  They said: "Shall we believe in two men like ourselves? And their people aresubject to us!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  So they accused them of falsehood, and they became of those who weredestroyed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  And We gave Moses the Book, in order that they might receive guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  And We made the son of Mary and his mother as a Sign: We gave them bothshelter on high ground, affording rest and security and furnished with springs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  O ye messengers! enjoy [all] things good and pure, and work righteousness:for I am well-acquainted with [all] that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  And verily this Brotherhood of yours is a single Brotherhood, and I am yourLord and Cherisher: therefore fear Me [and no other]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  But people have cut off their affair [of unity], between them, into sects:each party rejoices in that which is with itself. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  But leave them in their confused ignorance for a time. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth andsons, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  We would hasten them on in every good? Nay, they do not understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  Verily those who live in awe for fear of their Lord; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  Those who believe in the Signs of their Lord; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  Those who join not [in worship] partners with their Lord; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  And those who dispense their charity with their hearts full of fear, becausethey will return to their Lord;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  It is these who hasten in every good work, and these who are foremost inthem. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  On no soul do We place a burden greater than it can bear: before Us is arecord which clearly shows the truth: they will never be wronged. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  But their hearts are in confused ignorance of this; and there are, besidesthat, deeds of theirs, which they will [continue] to do,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  Until, when We seize in Punishment those of them who received the goodthings of this world, behold, they will groan in supplication! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  [It will be said]: "Groan not in supplication this day: for ye shallcertainly not be helped by Us. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  "My Signs used to be rehearsed to you, but ye used to turn back on yourheels-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  "In arrogance: talking nonsense about the [Qur'an], like one telling fablesby night." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  Do they not ponder over the Word [of Allah], or has anything [new] come tothem that did not come to their fathers of old? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  Or do they not recognise their Messenger, that they deny him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  Or do they say, "He is possessed"? Nay, he has brought them the Truth, butmost of them hate the Truth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  If the Truth had been in accord with their desires, truly the heavens andthe earth, and all beings therein would have been in confusion and corruption! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">Nay, We have sent them their admonition, but they turn away from theiradmonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">72.  Or is it that thou askest them for some recompense? But the recompense ofthy Lord is best: He is the Best of those who give sustenance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">73.  But verily thou callest them to the Straight Way; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">74.  And verily those who believe not in the Hereafter are deviating from thatWay. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">75.  If We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, theywould obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering in distraction toand fro. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">76.  We inflicted Punishment on them, but they humbled not themselves to theirLord, nor do they submissively entreat [Him]!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">77.  Until We open on them a gate leading to a severe Punishment: then Lo! theywill be plunged in despair therein! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">78.  It is He Who has created for you [the faculties of] hearing, sight, feelingand understanding: little thanks it is ye give! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">79.  And He has multiplied you through the earth, and to Him shall ye be gatheredback. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">80.  It is He Who gives life and death, and to Him [is due] the alternation ofNight and Day: will ye not then understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">81.  On the contrary they say things similar to what the ancients said. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">82.  They say: "What! when we die and become dust and bones, could we really beraised up again? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">83.  "Such things have been promised to us and to our fathers before! they arenothing but tales of the ancients!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">84.  Say: "To whom belong the earth and all beings therein? [say] if ye know!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">85.  They will say, "To Allah!" say: "Yet will ye not receive admonition?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">86.  Say: "Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the Throne [ofGlory] Supreme?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">87.  They will say, "[They belong] to Allah." Say: "Will ye not then be filledwith awe?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">88.  Say: "Who is it in whose hands is the governance of all things,- whoprotects [all], but is not protected [of any]? [say] if ye know." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">89.  They will say, "[It belongs] to Allah." Say: "Then how are ye deluded?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">90.  We have sent them the Truth: but they indeed practise falsehood! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">91.  No son did Allah beget, nor is there any god along with Him: [if there weremany gods], behold, each god would have taken away what he had created, and somewould have lorded it over others! Glory to Allah! [He is free] from the [sortof] things they attribute to Him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">92.  He knows what is hidden and what is open: too high is He for the partnersthey attribute to Him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">93.  Say: "O my Lord! if Thou wilt show me [in my lifetime] that which they arewarned against,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">94.  "Then, O my Lord! put me not amongst the people who do wrong!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">95.  And We are certainly able to show thee [in fulfilment] that against whichthey are warned. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">96.  Repel evil with that which is best: We are well acquainted with the thingsthey say. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">97.  And say "O my Lord! I seek refuge with Thee from the suggestions of the EvilOnes. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">98.  "And I seek refuge with Thee O my Lord! lest they should come near me." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">99.  [In Falsehood will they be] Until, when death comes to one of them, he says:"O my Lord! send me back [to life],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">100.  "In order that I may work righteousness in the things I neglected." - "Byno means! It is but a word he says."- Before them is a Partition till the Daythey are raised up. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">101.  Then when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no more relationships betweenthem that Day, nor will one ask after another! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">102.  Then those whose balance [of good deeds] is heavy,- they will attainsalvation: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">103.  But those whose balance is light, will be those who have lost their souls,in Hell will they abide. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">104.  The Fire will burn their faces, and they will therein grin, with their lipsdisplaced. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">105.  "Were not My Signs rehearsed to you, and ye did but treat them asfalsehood?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">106.  They will say: "our Lord! Our misfortune overwhelmed us, and we became apeople astray! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">107.  "Our Lord! bring us out of this: if ever we return [to Evil], then shall webe wrong-doers indeed!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">108.  He will say: "Be ye driven into it [with ignominy]! And speak ye not to Me! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">109.  "A part of My servants there was, who used to pray 'our Lord! we believe;then do Thou forgive us, and have mercy upon us: For Thou art the Best of thosewho show mercy!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">110.  "But ye treated them with ridicule, so much so that [ridicule of] them madeyou forget My Message while ye were laughing at them! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">111.  "I have rewarded them this Day for their patience and constancy: they areindeed the ones that have achieved Bliss..." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">112.  He will say: "What number of years did ye stay on earth?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">113.  They will say: "We stayed a day or part of a day: but ask those who keepaccount." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">114.  He will say: "Ye stayed not but a little,- if ye had only known! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">115.  "Did ye then think that We had created you in jest, and that ye would notbe brought back to Us [for account]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">116.  Therefore exalted be Allah, the King, the Reality: there is no god but He,the Lord of the Throne of Honour! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">117.  If anyone invokes, besides Allah, Any other god, he has no authoritytherefor; and his reckoning will be only with his Lord! and verily theUnbelievers will fail to win through! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">118.  So say: "O my Lord! grant Thou forgiveness and mercy for Thou art the Bestof those who show mercy!" </p>
