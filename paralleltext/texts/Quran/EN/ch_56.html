<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 56. Waqia, or The Inevitable Event </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  When the Event inevitable cometh to pass, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Then will no [soul] entertain falsehood concerning its coming. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  [Many] will it bring low; [many] will it exalt; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  When the earth shall be shaken to its depths, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And the mountains shall be crumbled to atoms, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Becoming dust scattered abroad, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  And ye shall be sorted out into three classes. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Then [there will be] the Companions of the Right Hand;- What will be theCompanions of the Right Hand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And the Companions of the Left Hand,- what will be the Companions of the LeftHand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And those Foremost [in Faith] will be Foremost [in the Hereafter]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  These will be those Nearest to Allah: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  In Gardens of Bliss: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  A number of people from those of old, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And a few from those of later times. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  [They will be] on Thrones encrusted [with gold and precious stones], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Reclining on them, facing each other. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Round about them will [serve] youths of perpetual [freshness], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  With goblets, [shining] beakers, and cups [filled] out of clear-flowingfountains: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  No after-ache will they receive therefrom, nor will they sufferintoxication: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And with fruits, any that they may select: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And the flesh of fowls, any that they may desire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  And [there will be] Companions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Like unto Pearls well-guarded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  A Reward for the deeds of their past [life]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Not frivolity will they hear therein, nor any taint of ill,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Only the saying, "Peace! Peace". </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  The Companions of the Right Hand,- what will be the Companions of the RightHand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  [They will be] among Lote-trees without thorns, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Among Talh trees with flowers [or fruits] piled one above another,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  In shade long-extended, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  By water flowing constantly, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And fruit in abundance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Whose season is not limited, nor [supply] forbidden, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  And on Thrones [of Dignity], raised high. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  We have created [their Companions] of special creation. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  And made them virgin - pure [and undefiled], -</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Beloved [by nature], equal in age,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  For the Companions of the Right Hand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  A [goodly] number from those of old, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  And a [goodly] number from those of later times. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  The Companions of the Left Hand,- what will be the Companions of the LeftHand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  [They will be] in the midst of a Fierce Blast of Fire and in Boiling Water, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  And in the shades of Black Smoke: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Nothing [will there be] to refresh, nor to please: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  For that they were wont to be indulged, before that, in wealth [and luxury], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  And persisted obstinately in wickedness supreme! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  And they used to say, "What! when we die and become dust and bones, shall wethen indeed be raised up again?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  "[We] and our fathers of old?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Say: "Yea, those of old and those of later times, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  "All will certainly be gathered together for the meeting appointed for a Daywell-known. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  "Then will ye truly,- O ye that go wrong, and treat [Truth] as Falsehood!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  "Ye will surely taste of the Tree of Zaqqum. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  "Then will ye fill your insides therewith, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  "And drink Boiling Water on top of it: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  "Indeed ye shall drink like diseased camels raging with thirst!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  Such will be their entertainment on the Day of Requital! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  It is We Who have created you: why will ye not witness the Truth? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  Do ye then see?- The [human Seed] that ye throw out,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  Is it ye who create it, or are We the Creators? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  We have decreed Death to be your common lot, and We are not to be frustrated </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  from changing your Forms and creating you [again] in [forms] that ye knownot. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  And ye certainly know already the first form of creation: why then do ye notcelebrate His praises? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  See ye the seed that ye sow in the ground? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  Is it ye that cause it to grow, or are We the Cause? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry powder, and ye would be left inwonderment, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  [Saying], "We are indeed left with debts [for nothing]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  "Indeed are we shut out [of the fruits of our labour]" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  See ye the water which ye drink? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  Do ye bring it down [in rain] from the cloud or do We? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  Were it Our Will, We could make it salt [and unpalatable]: then why do yenot give thanks? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  See ye the Fire which ye kindle? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  Is it ye who grow the tree which feeds the fire, or do We grow it? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  We have made it a memorial [of Our handiwork], and an article of comfort andconvenience for the denizens of deserts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  Then celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  Furthermore I call to witness the setting of the Stars,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  And that is indeed a mighty adjuration if ye but knew,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  That this is indeed a qur'an Most Honourable, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  In Book well-guarded, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  Which none shall touch but those who are clean: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  A Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  Is it such a Message that ye would hold in light esteem? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  And have ye made it your livelihood that ye should declare it false? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  Then why do ye not [intervene] when [the soul of the dying man] reaches thethroat,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  And ye the while [sit] looking on,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  But We are nearer to him than ye, and yet see not,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  Then why do ye not,- If you are exempt from [future] account,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  Call back the soul, if ye are true [in the claim of independence]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  Thus, then, if he be of those Nearest to Allah, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  [There is for him] Rest and Satisfaction, and a Garden of Delights. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  And if he be of the Companions of the Right Hand, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  [For him is the salutation], "Peace be unto thee", from the Companions ofthe Right Hand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  And if he be of those who treat [Truth] as Falsehood, who go wrong, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  For him is Entertainment with Boiling Water. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  And burning in Hell-Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  Verily, this is the Very Truth and Certainly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  So celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme. </p>
