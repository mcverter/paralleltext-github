<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 20. Ta Ha </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Ta-Ha. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  We have not sent down the Qur'an to thee to be [an occasion] for thydistress, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  But only as an admonition to those who fear [Allah],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the heavens on high. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  [Allah] Most Gracious is firmly established on the throne [of authority]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  To Him belongs what is in the heavens and on earth, and all between them, andall beneath the soil. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  If thou pronounce the word aloud, [it is no matter]: for verily He knowethwhat is secret and what is yet more hidden. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Allah! there is no god but He! To Him belong the most Beautiful Names. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Has the story of Moses reached thee? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Behold, he saw a fire: So he said to his family, "Tarry ye; I perceive afire; perhaps I can bring you some burning brand therefrom, or find someguidance at the fire." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard: "O Moses! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  "Verily I am thy Lord! therefore [in My presence] put off thy shoes: thouart in the sacred valley Tuwa. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  "I have chosen thee: listen, then, to the inspiration [sent to thee]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  "Verily, I am Allah: There is no god but I: So serve thou Me [only], andestablish regular prayer for celebrating My praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  "Verily the Hour is coming - My design is to keep it hidden - for every soulto receive its reward by the measure of its Endeavour. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  "Therefore let not such as believe not therein but follow their own lusts,divert thee therefrom, lest thou perish!".. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  "And what is that in the right hand, O Moses?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  He said, "It is my rod: on it I lean; with it I beat down fodder for myflocks; and in it I find other uses." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  [Allah] said, "Throw it, O Moses!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  He threw it, and behold! It was a snake, active in motion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  [Allah] said, "Seize it, and fear not: We shall return it at once to itsformer condition".. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  "Now draw thy hand close to thy side: It shall come forth white [andshining], without harm [or stain],- as another Sign,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  "In order that We may show thee [two] of our Greater Signs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  "Go thou to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  [Moses] said: "O my Lord! expand me my breast; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  "Ease my task for me; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "And remove the impediment from my speech, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  "So they may understand what I say: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "And give me a Minister from my family, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  "Aaron, my brother; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  "Add to my strength through him, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  "And make him share my task: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  "That we may celebrate Thy praise without stint, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  "And remember Thee without stint: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  "For Thou art He that [ever] regardeth us." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  [Allah] said: "Granted is thy prayer, O Moses!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  "And indeed We conferred a favour on thee another time [before]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  "Behold! We sent to thy mother, by inspiration, the message: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  "'Throw [the child] into the chest, and throw [the chest] into the river:the river will cast him up on the bank, and he will be taken up by one who is an </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">enemy to Me and an enemy to him': But I cast [the garment of] love over theefrom Me: and [this] in order that thou mayest be reared under Mine eye. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">40.  "Behold! thy sister goeth forth and saith, 'shall I show you one who willnurse and rear the [child]?' So We brought thee back to thy mother, that her eyemight be cooled and she should not grieve. Then thou didst slay a man, but Wesaved thee from trouble, and We tried thee in various ways. Then didst thoutarry a number of years with the people of Midian. Then didst thou come hitheras ordained, O Moses! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">41.  "And I have prepared thee for Myself [for service]".. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">42.  "Go, thou and thy brother, with My Signs, and slacken not, either of you, inkeeping Me in remembrance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">43.  "Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">44.  "But speak to him mildly; perchance he may take warning or fear [Allah]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">45.  They [Moses and Aaron] said: "Our Lord! We fear lest he hasten withinsolence against us, or lest he transgress all bounds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">46.  He said: "Fear not: for I am with you: I hear and see [everything]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">47.  "So go ye both to him, and say, 'Verily we are messengers sent by thy Lord:Send forth, therefore, the Children of Israel with us, and afflict them not:with a Sign, indeed, have we come from thy Lord! and peace to all who followguidance! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">48.  "'Verily it has been revealed to us that the Penalty [awaits] those whoreject and turn away.'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">49.  [When this message was delivered], [Pharaoh] said: "Who, then, O Moses, isthe Lord of you two?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">50.  He said: "Our Lord is He Who gave to each [created] thing its form andnature, and further, gave [it] guidance." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">51.  [Pharaoh] said: "What then is the condition of previous generations?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">52.  He replied: "The knowledge of that is with my Lord, duly recorded: my Lordnever errs, nor forgets,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">53.  "He Who has, made for you the earth like a carpet spread out; has enabledyou to go about therein by roads [and channels]; and has sent down water fromthe sky." With it have We produced diverse pairs of plants each separate fromthe others. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">54.  Eat [for yourselves] and pasture your cattle: verily, in this are Signs formen endued with understanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">55.  From the [earth] did We create you, and into it shall We return you, andfrom it shall We bring you out once again. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">56.  And We showed Pharaoh all Our Signs, but he did reject and refuse. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">57.  He said: "Hast thou come to drive us out of our land with thy magic, OMoses? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">58.  "But we can surely produce magic to match thine! So make a tryst between usand thee, which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor thou - in a placewhere both shall have even chances." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">59.  Moses said: "Your tryst is the Day of the Festival, and let the people beassembled when the sun is well up." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">60.  So Pharaoh withdrew: He concerted his plan, and then came [back]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">61.  Moses said to him: Woe to you! Forge not ye a lie against Allah, lest Hedestroy you [at once] utterly by chastisement: the forger must sufferfrustration!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">62.  So they disputed, one with another, over their affair, but they kept theirtalk secret. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">63.  They said: "These two are certainly [expert] magicians: their object is todrive you out from your land with their magic, and to do away with your mostcherished institutions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">64.  "Therefore concert your plan, and then assemble in [serried] ranks: He wins[all along] today who gains the upper hand." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">65.  They said: "O Moses! whether wilt thou that thou throw [first] or that we bethe first to throw?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">66.  He said, "Nay, throw ye first!" Then behold their ropes and their rods-so itseemed to him on account of their magic - began to be in lively motion! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">67.  So Moses conceived in his mind a [sort of] fear. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">68.  We said: "Fear not! for thou hast indeed the upper hand: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">69.  "Throw that which is in thy right hand: Quickly will it swallow up thatwhich they have faked what they have faked is but a magician's trick: and themagician thrives not, [no matter] where he goes." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">70.  So the magicians were thrown down to prostration: they said, "We believe inthe Lord of Aaron and Moses". </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">71.  [Pharaoh] said: "Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely thismust be your leader, who has taught you magic! be sure I will cut off your handsand feet on opposite sides, and I will have you crucified on trunks of palm-trees: so shall ye know for certain, which of us can give the more severe andthe more lasting punishment!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">72.  They said: "Never shall we regard thee as more than the Clear Signs thathave come to us, or than Him Who created us! so decree whatever thou desirest todecree: for thou canst only decree [touching] the life of this world. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">73.  "For us, we have believed in our Lord: may He forgive us our faults, and themagic to which thou didst compel us: for Allah is Best and Most Abiding." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">74.  Verily he who comes to his Lord as a sinner [at Judgment],- for him is Hell:therein shall he neither die nor live. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">75.  But such as come to Him as Believers who have worked righteous deeds,- forthem are ranks exalted,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">76.  Gardens of Eternity, beneath which flow rivers: they will dwell therein foraye: such is the reward of those who purify themselves [from evil]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">77.  We sent an inspiration to Moses: "Travel by night with My servants, andstrike a dry path for them through the sea, without fear of being overtaken [byPharaoh] and without [any other] fear." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">78.  Then Pharaoh pursued them with his forces, but the waters completelyoverwhelmed them and covered them up. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">79.  Pharaoh led his people astray instead of leading them aright. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">80.  O ye Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and We made aCovenant with you on the right side of Mount [Sinai], and We sent down to youManna and quails: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">81.  [Saying]: "Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance, butcommit no excess therein, lest My Wrath should justly descend on you: and thoseon whom descends My Wrath do perish indeed! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">82.  "But, without doubt, I am [also] He that forgives again and again, to thosewho repent, believe, and do right, who,- in fine, are ready to receive trueguidance." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">83.  [When Moses was up on the Mount, Allah said:] "What made thee hasten inadvance of thy people, O Moses?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">84.  He replied: "Behold, they are close on my footsteps: I hastened to thee, Omy Lord, to please thee." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">85.  [Allah] said: "We have tested thy people in thy absence: the Samiri has ledthem astray." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">86.  So Moses returned to his people in a state of indignation and sorrow. Hesaid: "O my people! did not your Lord make a handsome promise to you? Did thenthe promise seem to you long [in coming]? Or did ye desire that Wrath shoulddescend from your Lord on you, and so ye broke your promise to me?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">87.  They said: "We broke not the promise to thee, as far as lay in our power:but we were made to carry the weight of the ornaments of the [whole] people, andwe threw them [into the fire], and that was what the Samiri suggested. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">88.  "Then he brought out [of the fire] before the [people] the image of a calf:It seemed to low: so they said: This is your god, and the god of Moses, but[Moses] has forgotten!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">89.  Could they not see that it could not return them a word [for answer], andthat it had no power either to harm them or to do them good? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">90.  Aaron had already, before this said to them: "O my people! ye are beingtested in this: for verily your Lord is [Allah] Most Gracious; so follow me andobey my command." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">91.  They had said: "We will not abandon this cult, but we will devote ourselvesto it until Moses returns to us." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">92.  [Moses] said: "O Aaron! what kept thee back, when thou sawest them goingwrong, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">93.  "From following me? Didst thou then disobey my order?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">94.  [Aaron] replied: "O son of my mother! Seize [me] not by my beard nor by [thehair of] my head! Truly I feared lest thou shouldst say, 'Thou has caused adivision among the children of Israel, and thou didst not respect my word!'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">95.  [Moses] said: "What then is thy case, O Samiri?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">96.  He replied: "I saw what they saw not: so I took a handful [of dust] from thefootprint of the Messenger, and threw it [into the calf]: thus did my soulsuggest to me." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">97.  [Moses] said: "Get thee gone! but thy [punishment] in this life will be thatthou wilt say, 'touch me not'; and moreover [for a future penalty] thou hast apromise that will not fail: Now look at thy god, of whom thou hast become adevoted worshipper: We will certainly [melt] it in a blazing fire and scatter itbroadcast in the sea!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">98.  But the god of you all is the One Allah: there is no god but He: all thingsHe comprehends in His knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">99.  Thus do We relate to thee some stories of what happened before: for We havesent thee a Message from Our own Presence. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">100.  If any do turn away therefrom, verily they will bear a burden on the Day ofjudgment; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">101.  They will abide in this [state]: and grievous will the burden be to them onthat Day,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">102.  The Day when the Trumpet will be sounded: that Day, We shall gather thesinful, blear-eyed [with terror]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">103.  In whispers will they consult each other: "Yet tarried not longer than ten[Days]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">104.  We know best what they will say, when their leader most eminent in conductwill say: "Ye tarried not longer than a day!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">105.  They ask thee concerning the Mountains: say, "My Lord will uproot them andscatter them as dust; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">106.  "He will leave them as plains smooth and level; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">107.  "Nothing crooked or curved wilt thou see in their place." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">108.  On that Day will they follow the Caller [straight]: no crookedness [canthey show] him: all sounds shall humble themselves in the Presence of [Allah]Most Gracious: nothing shalt thou hear but the tramp of their feet [as theymarch]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">109.  On that Day shall no intercession avail except for those for whompermission has been granted by [Allah] Most Gracious and whose word isacceptable to Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">110.  He knows what [appears to His creatures as] before or after or behind them:but they shall not compass it with their knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">111.  [All] faces shall be humbled before [Him] - the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal: hopeless indeed will be the man that carries iniquity [onhis back]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">112.  But he who works deeds of righteousness, and has faith, will have no fearof harm nor of any curtailment [of what is his due]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">113.  Thus have We sent this down - an Arabic Qur'an - and explained therein indetail some of the warnings, in order that they may fear Allah, or that it maycause their remembrance [of Him]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">114.  High above all is Allah, the King, the Truth! Be not in haste with theQur'an before its revelation to thee is completed, but say, "O my Lord! advanceme in knowledge." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">115.  We had already, beforehand, taken the covenant of Adam, but he forgot: andWe found on his part no firm resolve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">116.  When We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves to Adam", they prostratedthemselves, but not Iblis: he refused. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">117.  Then We said: "O Adam! verily, this is an enemy to thee and thy wife: solet him not get you both out of the Garden, so that thou art landed in misery. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">118.  "There is therein [enough provision] for thee not to go hungry nor to gonaked, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">119.  "Nor to suffer from thirst, nor from the sun's heat." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="122">120.  But Satan whispered evil to him: he said, "O Adam! shall I lead thee to theTree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">121.  In the result, they both ate of the tree, and so their nakedness appearedto them: they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden:thus did Adam disobey his Lord, and allow himself to be seduced. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">122.  But his Lord chose him [for His Grace]: He turned to him, and gave himGuidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="125">123.  He said: "Get ye down, both of you,- all together, from the Garden, withenmity one to another: but if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance from Me,whosoever follows My Guidance, will not lose his way, nor fall into misery. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="126">124.  "But whosoever turns away from My Message, verily for him is a lifenarrowed down, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="127">125.  He will say: "O my Lord! why hast Thou raised me up blind, while I hadsight [before]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="128">126.  [Allah] will say: "Thus didst Thou, when Our Signs came unto thee,disregard them: so wilt thou, this day, be disregarded." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="129">127.  And thus do We recompense him who transgresses beyond bounds and believesnot in the Signs of his Lord: and the Penalty of the Hereafter is far moregrievous and more enduring. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="130">128.  Is it not a warning to such men [to call to mind] how many generationsbefore them We destroyed, in whose haunts they [now] move? Verily, in this areSigns for men endued with understanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="131">129.  Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, [theirpunishment] must necessarily have come; but there is a Term appointed [forrespite]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="132">130.  Therefore be patient with what they say, and celebrate [constantly] thepraises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun, and before its setting; yea,celebrate them for part of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day:that thou mayest have [spiritual] joy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="133">131.  Nor strain thine eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoymentto parties of them, the splendour of the life of this world, through which Wetest them: but the provision of thy Lord is better and more enduring. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="134">132.  Enjoin prayer on thy people, and be constant therein. We ask thee not toprovide sustenance: We provide it for thee. But the [fruit of] the Hereafter isfor righteousness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="135">133.  They say: "Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?" Has not a ClearSign come to them of all that was in the former Books of revelation? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="136">134.  And if We had inflicted on them a penalty before this, they would havesaid: "Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent us a messenger, we should certainlyhave followed Thy Signs before we were humbled and put to shame." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="137">135.  Say: "Each one [of us] is waiting: wait ye, therefore, and soon shall yeknow who it is that is on the straight and even way, and who it is that hasreceived Guidance." </p>
