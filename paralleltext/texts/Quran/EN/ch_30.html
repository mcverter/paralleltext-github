<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 30. Rum, or The Roman Empire </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Alif, Lam, Mim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  The Roman Empire has been defeated-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  In a land close by; but they, [even] after [this] defeat of theirs, will soonbe victorious-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Within a few years. With Allah is the Decision, in the past and in theFuture: on that Day shall the Believers rejoice-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  With the help of Allah. He helps whom He will, and He is exalted in might,most merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  [It is] the promise of Allah. Never does Allah depart from His promise: butmost men understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  They know but the outer [things] in the life of this world: but of the End ofthings they are heedless. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Do they not reflect in their own minds? Not but for just ends and for a termappointed, did Allah create the heavens and the earth, and all between them: yetare there truly many among men who deny the meeting with their Lord [at theResurrection]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of thosebefore them? They were superior to them in strength: they tilled the soil andpopulated it in greater numbers than these have done: there came to them theirmessengers with Clear [Signs]. [Which they rejected, to their own destruction]:It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged their own souls. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  In the long run evil in the extreme will be the End of those who do evil;for that they rejected the Signs of Allah, and held them up to ridicule. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  It is Allah Who begins [the process of] creation; then repeats it; thenshall ye be brought back to Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  On the Day that the Hour will be established, the guilty will be struck dumbwith despair. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  No intercessor will they have among their "Partners" and they will[themselves] reject their "Partners". </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  On the Day that the Hour will be established,- that Day shall [all men] besorted out. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Then those who have believed and worked righteous deeds, shall be made happyin a Mead of Delight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  And those who have rejected Faith and falsely denied our Signs and themeeting of the Hereafter,- such shall be brought forth to Punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  So [give] glory to Allah, when ye reach eventide and when ye rise in themorning; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Yea, to Him be praise, in the heavens and on earth; and in the lateafternoon and when the day begins to decline. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  It is He Who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the deadfrom the living, and Who gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thusshall ye be brought out [from the dead]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Among His Signs in this, that He created you from dust; and then,- behold,ye are men scattered [far and wide]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from amongyourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love andmercy between your [hearts]: verily in that are Signs for those who reflect. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and thevariations in your languages and your colours: verily in that are Signs forthose who know. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  And among His Signs is the sleep that ye take by night and by day, and thequest that ye [make for livelihood] out of His Bounty: verily in that are signsfor those who hearken. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  And among His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and ofhope, and He sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earthafter it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  And among His Signs is this, that heaven and earth stand by His Command:then when He calls you, by a single call, from the earth, behold, ye[straightway] come forth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  To Him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth: all aredevoutly obedient to Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  It is He Who begins [the process of] creation; then repeats it; and for Himit is most easy. To Him belongs the loftiest similitude [we can think of] in theheavens and the earth: for He is Exalted in Might, full of wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  He does propound to you a similitude from your own [experience]: do ye havepartners among those whom your right hands possess, to share as equals in thewealth We have bestowed on you? Do ye fear them as ye fear each other? Thus dowe explain the Signs in detail to a people that understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Nay, the wrong-doers [merely] follow their own lusts, being devoid ofknowledge. But who will guide those whom Allah leaves astray? To them there willbe no helpers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  So set thou thy face steadily and truly to the Faith: [establish] Allah'shandiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change [letthere be] in the work [wrought] by Allah: that is the standard Religion: butmost among mankind understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Turn ye back in repentance to Him, and fear Him: establish regular prayers,and be not ye among those who join gods with Allah,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Those who split up their Religion, and become [mere] Sects,- each partyrejoicing in that which is with itself! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  When trouble touches men, they cry to their Lord, turning back to Him inrepentance: but when He gives them a taste of Mercy as from Himself, behold,some of them pay part-worship to other god's besides their Lord,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  [As if] to show their ingratitude for the [favours] We have bestowed onthem! Then enjoy [your brief day]; but soon will ye know [your folly]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Or have We sent down authority to them, which points out to them the thingsto which they pay part-worship? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  When We give men a taste of Mercy, they exult thereat: and when some evilafflicts them because of what their [own] hands have sent forth, behold, theyare in despair! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  See they not that Allah enlarges the provision and restricts it, towhomsoever He pleases? Verily in that are Signs for those who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  So give what is due to kindred, the needy, and the wayfarer. That is bestfor those who seek the Countenance, of Allah, and it is they who will prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  That which ye lay out for increase through the property of [other] people,will have no increase with Allah: but that which ye lay out for charity, seeking </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">the Countenance of Allah, [will increase]: it is these who will get a recompensemultiplied. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">40.  It is Allah Who has created you: further, He has provided for yoursustenance; then He will cause you to die; and again He will give you life. Arethere any of your [false] "Partners" who can do any single one of these things?Glory to Him! and high is He above the partners they attribute [to him]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">41.  Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of [the meed] that the handsof men have earned, that [Allah] may give them a taste of some of their deeds:in order that they may turn back [from Evil]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">42.  Say: "Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those before[you]: Most of them worshipped others besides Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">43.  But set thou thy face to the right Religion before there come from Allah theDay which there is no chance of averting: on that Day shall men be divided [intwo]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">44.  Those who reject Faith will suffer from that rejection: and those who workrighteousness will spread their couch [of repose] for themselves [in heaven]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">45.  That He may reward those who believe and work righteous deeds, out of hisBounty. For He loves not those who reject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">46.  Among His Signs is this, that He sends the Winds, as heralds of GladTidings, giving you a taste of His [Grace and] Mercy,- that the ships may sail[majestically] by His Command and that ye may seek of His Bounty: in order thatye may be grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">47.  We did indeed send, before thee, messengers to their [respective] peoples,and they came to them with Clear Signs: then, to those who transgressed, Wemeted out Retribution: and it was due from Us to aid those who believed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">48.  It is Allah Who sends the Winds, and they raise the Clouds: then does Hespread them in the sky as He wills, and break them into fragments, until thouseest rain-drops issue from the midst thereof: then when He has made them reachsuch of his servants as He wills behold, they do rejoice!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">49.  Even though, before they received [the rain] - just before this - they weredumb with despair! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">50.  Then contemplate [O man!] the memorials of Allah's Mercy!- how He gives lifeto the earth after its death: verily the same will give life to the men who aredead: for He has power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">51.  And if We [but] send a Wind from which they see [their tilth] turn yellow,-behold, they become, thereafter, Ungrateful [Unbelievers]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">52.  So verily thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deafto hear the call, when they show their backs and turn away. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">53.  Nor canst thou lead back the blind from their straying: only those wilt thoumake to hear, who believe in Our signs and submit [their wills in Islam]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">54.  It is Allah Who created you in a state of [helpless] weakness, then gave[you] strength after weakness, then, after strength, gave [you weakness and ahoary head: He creates as He wills, and it is He Who has all knowledge andpower. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">55.  On the Day that the Hour [of Reckoning] will be established, thetransgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour: thus were they usedto being deluded! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">56.  But those endued with knowledge and faith will say: "Indeed ye did tarry,within Allah's Decree, to the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day ofResurrection: but ye - ye were not aware!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">57.  So on that Day no excuse of theirs will avail the transgressors, nor willthey be invited [then] to seek grace [by repentance]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">58.  verily We have propounded for men, in this Qur'an every kind of Parable: Butif thou bring to them any Sign, the Unbelievers are sure to say, "Ye do nothingbut talk vanities." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">59.  Thus does Allah seal up the hearts of those who understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">60.  So patiently persevere: for verily the promise of Allah is true: nor letthose shake thy firmness, who have [themselves] no certainty of faith. </p>
