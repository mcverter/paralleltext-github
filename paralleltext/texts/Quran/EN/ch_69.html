<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 69. Haqqa, or the Sure Reality </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  The Sure Reality! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  What is the Sure Reality? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And what will make thee realise what the Sure Reality is? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  The Thamud and the 'Ad People [branded] as false the Stunning Calamity! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  But the Thamud,- they were destroyed by a terrible Storm of thunder andlightning! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And the 'Ad, they were destroyed by a furious Wind, exceedingly violent; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  He made it rage against them seven nights and eight days in succession: sothat thou couldst see the [whole] people lying prostrate in its [path], as theyhad been roots of hollow palm-trees tumbled down! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Then seest thou any of them left surviving? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And Pharaoh, and those before him, and the Cities Overthrown, committedhabitual Sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And disobeyed [each] the messenger of their Lord; so He punished them withan abundant Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  We, when the water [of Noah's Flood] overflowed beyond its limits, carriedyou [mankind], in the floating [Ark], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  That We might make it a Message unto you, and that ears [that should hearthe tale and] retain its memory should bear its [lessons] in remembrance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Then, when one blast is sounded on the Trumpet, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And the earth is moved, and its mountains, and they are crushed to powder atone stroke,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  On that Day shall the [Great] Event come to pass. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  And the sky will be rent asunder, for it will that Day be flimsy, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  And the angels will be on its sides, and eight will, that Day, bear theThrone of thy Lord above them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  That Day shall ye be brought to Judgment: not an act of yours that ye hidewill be hidden. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Then he that will be given his Record in his right hand will say: "Ah here!Read ye my Record! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  "I did really understand that my Account would [One Day] reach me!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And he will be in a life of Bliss, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  In a Garden on high, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  The Fruits whereof [will hang in bunches] low and near. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  "Eat ye and drink ye, with full satisfaction; because of the [good] that yesent before you, in the days that are gone!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  And he that will be given his Record in his left hand, will say: "Ah! Wouldthat my Record had not been given to me! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  "And that I had never realised how my account [stood]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "Ah! Would that [Death] had made an end of me! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  "Of no profit to me has been my wealth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "My power has perished from me!"... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  [The stern command will say]: "Seize ye him, and bind ye him, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  "And burn ye him in the Blazing Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  "Further, make him march in a chain, whereof the length is seventy cubits! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  "This was he that would not believe in Allah Most High. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  "And would not encourage the feeding of the indigent! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  "So no friend hath he here this Day. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  "Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  "Which none do eat but those in sin." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  So I do call to witness what ye see, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  And what ye see not, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  That this is verily the word of an honoured messenger; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  It is not the word of a poet: little it is ye believe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Nor is it the word of a soothsayer: little admonition it is ye receive. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  [This is] a Message sent down from the Lord of the Worlds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  And if the messenger were to invent any sayings in Our name, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  We should certainly seize him by his right hand, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  And We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Nor could any of you withhold him [from Our wrath]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  But verily this is a Message for the Allah-fearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  And We certainly know that there are amongst you those that reject [it]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  But truly [Revelation] is a cause of sorrow for the Unbelievers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  But verily it is Truth of assured certainty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  So glorify the name of thy Lord Most High. </p>
