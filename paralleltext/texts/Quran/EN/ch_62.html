<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 62. Jumua, or the Assembly (Friday) Prayer. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare the Praises and Gloryof Allah,- the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  It is He Who has sent amongst the Unlettered a messenger from amongthemselves, to rehearse to them His Signs, to sanctify them, and to instructthem in Scripture and Wisdom,- although they had been, before, in manifesterror;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  As well as [to confer all these benefits upon] others of them, who have notalready joined them: And He is exalted in Might, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Such is the Bounty of Allah, which He bestows on whom He will: and Allah isthe Lord of the highest bounty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  The similitude of those who were charged with the [obligations of the] MosaicLaw, but who subsequently failed in those [obligations], is that of a donkeywhich carries huge tomes [but understands them not]. Evil is the similitude ofpeople who falsify the Signs of Allah: and Allah guides not people who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Say: "O ye that stand on Judaism! If ye think that ye are friends to Allah,to the exclusion of [other] men, then express your desire for Death, if ye aretruthful!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  But never will they express their desire [for Death], because of the [deeds]their hands have sent on before them! and Allah knows well those that do wrong! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Say: "The Death from which ye flee will truly overtake you: then will ye besent back to the Knower of things secret and open: and He will tell you [thetruth of] the things that ye did!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  O ye who believe! When the call is proclaimed to prayer on Friday [the Day ofAssembly], hasten earnestly to the Remembrance of Allah, and leave off business[and traffic]: That is best for you if ye but knew! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And when the Prayer is finished, then may ye disperse through the land, andseek of the Bounty of Allah: and celebrate the Praises of Allah often [andwithout stint]: that ye may prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  But when they see some bargain or some amusement, they disperse headlong toit, and leave thee standing. Say: "The [blessing] from the Presence of Allah isbetter than any amusement or bargain! and Allah is the Best to provide [for allneeds]." </p>
