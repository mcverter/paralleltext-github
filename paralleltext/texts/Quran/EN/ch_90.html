<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 90. Balad, or The City </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  I do call to witness this City;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  And thou art a freeman of this City;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And [the mystic ties of] parent and child;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Verily We have created man into toil and struggle. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Thinketh he, that none hath power over him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  He may say [boastfully]; Wealth have I squandered in abundance! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Thinketh he that none beholdeth him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Have We not made for him a pair of eyes?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And a tongue, and a pair of lips?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And shown him the two highways? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  But he hath made no haste on the path that is steep. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And what will explain to thee the path that is steep?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  [It is:] freeing the bondman; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Or the giving of food in a day of privation </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  To the orphan with claims of relationship, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Or to the indigent [down] in the dust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Then will he be of those who believe, and enjoin patience, [constancy, andself-restraint], and enjoin deeds of kindness and compassion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Such are the Companions of the Right Hand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  But those who reject Our Signs, they are the [unhappy] Companions of theLeft Hand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  On them will be Fire vaulted over [all round]. </p>
