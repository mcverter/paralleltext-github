<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 70. Maarij, or the Ways of Ascent </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  A questioner asked about a Penalty to befall-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  The Unbelievers, the which there is none to ward off,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  [A Penalty] from Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  The angels and the spirit ascend unto him in a Day the measure whereof is[as] fifty thousand years: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Therefore do thou hold Patience,- a Patience of beautiful [contentment]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  They see the [Day] indeed as a far-off [event]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  But We see it [quite] near. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  The Day that the sky will be like molten brass, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And the mountains will be like wool, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And no friend will ask after a friend, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Though they will be put in sight of each other,- the sinner's desire willbe: Would that he could redeem himself from the Penalty of that Day by[sacrificing] his children, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  His wife and his brother, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  His kindred who sheltered him, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And all, all that is on earth,- so it could deliver him: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  By no means! for it would be the Fire of Hell!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Plucking out [his being] right to the skull!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Inviting [all] such as turn their backs and turn away their faces [from theRight]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  And collect [wealth] and hide it [from use]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Truly man was created very impatient;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Fretful when evil touches him; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And niggardly when good reaches him;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Not so those devoted to Prayer;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Those who remain steadfast to their prayer; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  And those in whose wealth is a recognised right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  For the [needy] who asks and him who is prevented [for some reason fromasking]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And those who hold to the truth of the Day of Judgment; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And those who fear the displeasure of their Lord,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  For their Lord's displeasure is the opposite of Peace and Tranquillity;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  And those who guard their chastity, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Except with their wives and the [captives] whom their right hands possess,-for [then] they are not to be blamed, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  But those who trespass beyond this are transgressors;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And those who respect their trusts and covenants; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  And those who stand firm in their testimonies; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  And those who guard [the sacredness] of their worship;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Such will be the honoured ones in the Gardens [of Bliss]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Now what is the matter with the Unbelievers that they rush madly beforethee-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  From the right and from the left, in crowds? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Does every man of them long to enter the Garden of Bliss? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  By no means! For We have created them out of the [base matter] they know! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Now I do call to witness the Lord of all points in the East and the Westthat We can certainly-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Substitute for them better [men] than they; And We are not to be defeated[in Our Plan]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  So leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about, until they encounterthat Day of theirs which they have been promised!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  The Day whereon they will issue from their sepulchres in sudden haste as ifthey were rushing to a goal-post [fixed for them],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Their eyes lowered in dejection,- ignominy covering them [all over]! such isthe Day the which they are promised! </p>
