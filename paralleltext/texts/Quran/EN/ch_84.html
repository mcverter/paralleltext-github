<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 84. Inshiqaq, or The Rending Asunder </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  When the sky is rent asunder, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  And hearkens to [the Command of] its Lord, and it must needs [do so];-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And when the earth is flattened out, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And casts forth what is within it and becomes [clean] empty, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And hearkens to [the Command of] its Lord,- and it must needs [do so];- [thenwill come Home the full reality]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  O thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy Lord- painfullytoiling,- but thou shalt meet Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Then he who is given his Record in his right hand, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Soon will his account be taken by an easy reckoning, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And he will turn to his people, rejoicing! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  But he who is given his Record behind his back,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Soon will he cry for perdition, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And he will enter a Blazing Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Truly, did he go about among his people, rejoicing! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Truly, did he think that he would not have to return [to Us]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Nay, nay! for his Lord was [ever] watchful of him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  So I do call to witness the ruddy glow of Sunset; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  The Night and its Homing; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  And the Moon in her fullness: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Ye shall surely travel from stage to stage. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  What then is the matter with them, that they believe not?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And when the Qur'an is read to them, they fall not prostrate, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  But on the contrary the Unbelievers reject [it]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  But Allah has full knowledge of what they secrete [in their breasts] </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  So announce to them a Penalty Grievous, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Except to those who believe and work righteous deeds: For them is a Rewardthat will never fail. </p>
