<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 47. Muhammad (the Prophet) </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Those who reject Allah and hinder [men] from the Path of Allah,- their deedswill Allah render astray [from their mark]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and believe in the[Revelation] sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord,- Hewill remove from them their ills and improve their condition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  This because those who reject Allah follow vanities, while those who believefollow the Truth from their Lord: Thus does Allah set forth for men their lessons by similitudes. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers [in fight], smite at their necks; Atlength, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly [on them]:thereafter [is the time for] either generosity or ransom: Until the war laysdown its burdens. Thus [are ye commanded]: but if it had been Allah's Will, Hecould certainly have exacted retribution from them [Himself]; but [He lets youfight] in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in theWay of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Soon will He guide them and improve their condition, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  O ye who believe! If ye will aid [the cause of] Allah, He will aid you, andplant your feet firmly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  But those who reject [Allah],- for them is destruction, and [Allah] willrender their deeds astray [from their mark]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  That is because they hate the Revelation of Allah; so He has made their deedsfruitless. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of thosebefore them [who did evil]? Allah brought utter destruction on them, and similar[fates await] those who reject Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, but those whoreject Allah have no protector. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Verily Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds, to Gardensbeneath which rivers flow; while those who reject Allah will enjoy [this world]and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And how many cities, with more power than thy city which has driven theeout, have We destroyed [for their sins]? and there was none to aid them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Is then one who is on a clear [Path] from his Lord, no better than one towhom the evil of his conduct seems pleasing, and such as follow their own lusts? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  [Here is] a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised: in itare rivers of water incorruptible; rivers of milk of which the taste neverchanges; rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink; and rivers of honey pure andclear. In it there are for them all kinds of fruits; and Grace from their Lord.[Can those in such Bliss] be compared to such as shall dwell for ever in theFire, and be given, to drink, boiling water, so that it cuts up their bowels [topieces]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  And among them are men who listen to thee, but in the end, when they go outfrom thee, they say to those who have received Knowledge, "What is it he saidjust then?" Such are men whose hearts Allah has sealed, and who follow their ownlusts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  But to those who receive Guidance, He increases the [light of] Guidance, andbestows on them their Piety and Restraint [from evil]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Do they then only wait for the Hour,- that it should come on them of asudden? But already have come some tokens thereof, and when it [actually] is onthem, how can they benefit then by their admonition? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Know, therefore, that there is no god but Allah, and ask forgiveness for thyfault, and for the men and women who believe: for Allah knows how ye move aboutand how ye dwell in your homes. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Those who believe say, "Why is not a Sura sent down [for us]?" But when aSura of basic or categorical meaning is revealed, and fighting is mentionedtherein, thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with alook of one in swoon at the approach of death. But more fitting for them-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Were it to obey and say what is just, and when a matter is resolved on, itwere best for them if they were true to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Then, is it to be expected of you, if ye were put in authority, that ye willdo mischief in the land, and break your ties of kith and kin? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Such are the men whom Allah has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Qur'an, or are theirhearts locked up by them? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them,-the Evil One has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  This, because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed, "We willobey you in part of [this] matter"; but Allah knows their [inner] secrets. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  But how [will it be] when the angels take their souls at death, and smitetheir faces and their backs? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath of Allah, andthey hated Allah's good pleasure; so He made their deeds of no effect. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Or do those in whose hearts is a disease, think that Allah will not bring tolight all their rancour? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Had We so wiled, We could have shown them up to thee, and thou shouldst haveknown them by their marks: but surely thou wilt know them by the tone of theirspeech! And Allah knows all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  And We shall try you until We test those among you who strive their utmostand persevere in patience; and We shall try your reported [mettle]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Those who reject Allah, hinder [men] from the Path of Allah, and resist theMessenger, after Guidance has been clearly shown to them, will not injure Allahin the least, but He will make their deeds of no effect. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger, and make not vain yourdeeds! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Those who reject Allah, and hinder [men] from the Path of Allah, then dierejecting Allah,- Allah will not forgive them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Be not weary and faint-hearted, crying for peace, when ye should beuppermost: for Allah is with you, and will never put you in loss for your [good]deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  The life of this world is but play and amusement: and if ye believe andguard against Evil, He will grant you your recompense, and will not ask you [togive up] your possessions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  If He were to ask you for all of them, and press you, ye would covetouslywithhold, and He would bring out all your ill-feeling. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Behold, ye are those invited to spend [of your substance] in the Way ofAllah: But among you are some that are niggardly. But any who are niggardly areso at the expense of their own souls. But Allah is free of all wants, and it isye that are needy. If ye turn back [from the Path], He will substitute in yourstead another people; then they would not be like you! </p>
