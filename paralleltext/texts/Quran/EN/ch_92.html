<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 92. Lail, or The Night </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  By the Night as it conceals [the light]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  By the Day as it appears in glory; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  By [the mystery of] the creation of male and female;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Verily, [the ends] ye strive for are diverse. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  So he who gives [in charity] and fears [Allah], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And [in all sincerity] testifies to the best,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Bliss. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And gives the lie to the best,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Misery; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Nor will his wealth profit him when he falls headlong [into the Pit]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Verily We take upon Ourselves to guide, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  And verily unto Us [belong] the End and the Beginning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Therefore do I warn you of a Fire blazing fiercely; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  None shall reach it but those most unfortunate ones </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Who give the lie to Truth and turn their backs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  But those most devoted to Allah shall be removed far from it,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And have in their minds no favour from anyone for which a reward is expectedin return, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  But only the desire to seek for the Countenance of their Lord Most High; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And soon will they attain [complete] satisfaction. </p>
