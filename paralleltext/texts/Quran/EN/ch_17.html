<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 17. Bani Israil, or the Children of Israel </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Glory to [Allah] Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from theSacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless,- in orderthat We might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who heareth andseeth [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  We gave Moses the Book, and made it a Guide to the Children of Israel,[commanding]: "Take not other than Me as Disposer of [your] affairs." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  O ye that are sprung from those whom We carried [in the Ark] with Noah!Verily he was a devotee most grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And We gave [Clear] Warning to the Children of Israel in the Book, that twicewould they do mischief on the earth and be elated with mighty arrogance [andtwice would they be punished]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  When the first of the warnings came to pass, We sent against you Our servantsgiven to terrible warfare: They entered the very inmost parts of your homes; andit was a warning [completely] fulfilled. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Then did We grant you the Return as against them: We gave you increase inresources and sons, and made you the more numerous in man-power. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  If ye did well, ye did well for yourselves; if ye did evil, [ye did it]against yourselves. So when the second of the warnings came to pass, [Wepermitted your enemies] to disfigure your faces, and to enter your Temple asthey had entered it before, and to visit with destruction all that fell intotheir power. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  It may be that your Lord may [yet] show Mercy unto you; but if ye revert [toyour sins], We shall revert [to Our punishments]: And we have made Hell a prisonfor those who reject [all Faith]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Verily this Qur'an doth guide to that which is most right [or stable], andgiveth the Glad Tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, thatthey shall have a magnificent reward; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And to those who believe not in the Hereafter, [it announceth] that We haveprepared for them a Penalty Grievous [indeed]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  The prayer that man should make for good, he maketh for evil; for man isgiven to hasty [deeds]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  We have made the Night and the Day as two [of Our] Signs: the Sign of theNight have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten you;that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the number andcount of the years: all things have We explained in detail. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Every man's fate We have fastened on his own neck: On the Day of Judgment Weshall bring out for him a scroll, which he will see spread open. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  [It will be said to him:] "Read thine [own] record: Sufficient is thy soulthis day to make out an account against thee." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Who receiveth guidance, receiveth it for his own benefit: who goeth astraydoth so to his own loss: No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another: nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent an messenger [to givewarning]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  When We decide to destroy a population, We [first] send a definite order tothose among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress;so that the word is proved true against them: then [it is] We destroy themutterly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  How many generations have We destroyed after Noah? and enough is thy Lord tonote and see the sins of His servants. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  If any do wish for the transitory things [of this life], We readily grantthem - such things as We will, to such person as We will: in the end have Weprovided Hell for them: they will burn therein, disgraced and rejected. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Those who do wish for the [things of] the Hereafter, and strive thereforwith all due striving, and have Faith,- they are the ones whose striving isacceptable [to Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Of the bounties of thy Lord We bestow freely on all- These as well as those:The bounties of thy Lord are not closed [to anyone]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  See how We have bestowed more on some than on others; but verily theHereafter is more in rank and gradation and more in excellence. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Take not with Allah another object of worship; or thou [O man!] wilt sit indisgrace and destitution. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but Him, and that ye be kind toparents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life, say not to thema word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honour. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  And, out of kindness, lower to them the wing of humility, and say: "My Lord!bestow on them thy Mercy even as they cherished me in childhood." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Your Lord knoweth best what is in your hearts: If ye do deeds ofrighteousness, verily He is Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him again andagain [in true penitence]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And render to the kindred their due rights, as [also] to those in want, andto the wayfarer: But squander not [your wealth] in the manner of a spendthrift. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  Verily spendthrifts are brothers of the Evil Ones; and the Evil One is tohis Lord [himself] ungrateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  And even if thou hast to turn away from them in pursuit of the Mercy fromthy Lord which thou dost expect, yet speak to them a word of easy kindness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Make not thy hand tied [like a niggard's] to thy neck, nor stretch it forthto its utmost reach, so that thou become blameworthy and destitute. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Verily thy Lord doth provide sustenance in abundance for whom He pleaseth,and He provideth in a just measure. For He doth know and regard all Hisservants. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance forthem as well as for you. Verily the killing of them is a great sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Nor come nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful [deed] and an evil, openingthe road [to other evils]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Nor take life - which Allah has made sacred - except for just cause. And ifanyone is slain wrongfully, we have given his heir authority [to demand qisas orto forgive]: but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for heis helped [by the Law]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Come not nigh to the orphan's property except to improve it, until heattains the age of full strength; and fulfil [every] engagement, for [every]engagement will be enquired into [on the Day of Reckoning]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Give full measure when ye measure, and weigh with a balance that isstraight: that is the most fitting and the most advantageous in the finaldetermination. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  And pursue not that of which thou hast no knowledge; for every act ofhearing, or of seeing or of [feeling in] the heart will be enquired into [on theDay of Reckoning]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Nor walk on the earth with insolence: for thou canst not rend the earth asunder, nor reach the mountains in height. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Of all such things the evil is hateful in the sight of thy Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  These are among the [precepts of] wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed tothee. Take not, with Allah, another object of worship, lest thou shouldst bethrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Has then your Lord [O Pagans!] preferred for you sons, and taken for Himselfdaughters among the angels? Truly ye utter a most dreadful saying! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  We have explained [things] in various [ways] in this Qur'an, in order thatthey may receive admonition, but it only increases their flight [from theTruth]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Say: If there had been [other] gods with Him, as they say,- behold, theywould certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  Glory to Him! He is high above all that they say!- Exalted and Great [beyondmeasure]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  The seven heavens and the earth, and all beings therein, declare His glory:there is not a thing but celebrates His praise; And yet ye understand not howthey declare His glory! Verily He is Oft-Forbear, Most Forgiving! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  When thou dost recite the Qur'an, We put, between thee and those who believenot in the Hereafter, a veil invisible: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  And We put coverings over their hearts [and minds] lest they shouldunderstand the Qur'an, and deafness into their ears: when thou dost commemoratethy Lord and Him alone in the Qur'an, they turn on their backs, fleeing [fromthe Truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  We know best why it is they listen, when they listen to thee; and when theymeet in private conference, behold, the wicked say, "Ye follow none other than aman bewitched!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  See what similes they strike for thee: but they have gone astray, and nevercan they find a way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  They say: "What! when we are reduced to bones and dust, should we really beraised up [to be] a new creation?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  Say: "[Nay!] be ye stones or iron, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  "Or created matter which, in your minds, is hardest [to be raised up],- [Yetshall ye be raised up]!" then will they say: "Who will cause us to return?" Say:"He who created you first!" Then will they wag their heads towards thee, andsay, "When will that be?" Say, "May be it will be quite soon! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  "It will be on a Day when He will call you, and ye will answer [His call]with [words of] His praise, and ye will think that ye tarried but a littlewhile!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  Say to My servants that they should [only] say those things that are best:for Satan doth sow dissensions among them: For Satan is to man an avowed enemy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  It is your Lord that knoweth you best: If He please, He granteth you mercy,or if He please, punishment: We have not sent thee to be a disposer of theiraffairs for them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  And it is your Lord that knoweth best all beings that are in the heavens andon earth: We did bestow on some prophets more [and other] gifts than on others:and We gave to David [the gift of] the Psalms. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  Say: "Call on those - besides Him - whom ye fancy: they have neither thepower to remove your troubles from you nor to change them." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  Those whom they call upon do desire [for themselves] means of access totheir Lord, - even those who are nearest: they hope for His Mercy and fear HisWrath: for the Wrath of thy Lord is something to take heed of. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgmentor punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the [eternal] Record. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  And We refrain from sending the signs, only because the men of formergenerations treated them as false: We sent the she-camel to the Thamud to opentheir eyes, but they treated her wrongfully: We only send the Signs by way ofterror [and warning from evil]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  Behold! We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round about: Wegranted the vision which We showed thee, but as a trial for men,- as also theCursed Tree [mentioned] in the Qur'an: We put terror [and warning] into them,but it only increases their inordinate transgression! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  Behold! We said to the angels: "Bow down unto Adam": They bowed down exceptIblis: He said, "Shall I bow down to one whom Thou didst create from clay?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  He said: "Seest Thou? this is the one whom Thou hast honoured above me! If Thou wilt but respite me to the Day of Judgment, I will surely bring hisdescendants under my sway - all but a few!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  [Allah] said: "Go thy way; if any of them follow thee, verily Hell will bethe recompense of you [all]- an ample recompense. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  "Lead to destruction those whom thou canst among them, with thy [seductive]voice; make assaults on them with thy cavalry and thy infantry; mutually sharewith them wealth and children; and make promises to them." But Satan promisesthem nothing but deceit. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  "As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:" Enough is thyLord for a Disposer of affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  Your Lord is He That maketh the Ship go smoothly for you through the sea, inorder that ye may seek of his Bounty. For he is unto you most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  When distress seizes you at sea, those that ye call upon - besides Himself -leave you in the lurch! but when He brings you back safe to land, ye turn away[from Him]. Most ungrateful is man! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  Do ye then feel secure that He will not cause you to be swallowed up beneaththe earth when ye are on land, or that He will not send against you a violenttornado [with showers of stones] so that ye shall find no one to carry out youraffairs for you? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  Or do ye feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea andsend against you a heavy gale to drown you because of your ingratitude, so thatye find no helper. Therein against Us? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  We have honoured the sons of Adam; provided them with transport on land andsea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on themspecial favours, above a great part of our creation. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  One day We shall call together all human beings with their [respective]Imams: those who are given their record in their right hand will read it [withpleasure], and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  But those who were blind in this world, will be blind in the hereafter, andmost astray from the Path. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  And their purpose was to tempt thee away from that which We had revealedunto thee, to substitute in our name something quite different; [in that case],behold! they would certainly have made thee [their] friend! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  And had We not given thee strength, thou wouldst nearly have inclined tothem a little. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  In that case We should have made thee taste an equal portion [of punishment]in this life, and an equal portion in death: and moreover thou wouldst havefound none to help thee against Us! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  Their purpose was to scare thee off the land, in order to expel thee; but inthat case they would not have stayed [therein] after thee, except for a littlewhile. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  [This was Our] way with the messengers We sent before thee: thou wilt findno change in Our ways. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  Establish regular prayers - at the sun's decline till the darkness of thenight, and the morning prayer and reading: for the prayer and reading in themorning carry their testimony. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  And pray in the small watches of the morning: [it would be] an additionalprayer [or spiritual profit] for thee: soon will thy Lord raise thee to aStation of Praise and Glory! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  Say: "O my Lord! Let my entry be by the Gate of Truth and Honour, andlikewise my exit by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and grant me from Thy Presencean authority to aid [me]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  And say: "Truth has [now] arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is[by its nature] bound to perish." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  We send down [stage by stage] in the Qur'an that which is a healing and amercy to those who believe: to the unjust it causes nothing but loss after loss. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  Yet when We bestow Our favours on man, he turns away and becomes remote onhis side [instead of coming to Us], and when evil seizes him he gives himself upto despair! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  Say: "Everyone acts according to his own disposition: But your Lord knowsbest who it is that is best guided on the Way." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  They ask thee concerning the Spirit [of inspiration]. Say: "The Spirit[cometh] by command of my Lord: of knowledge it is only a little that iscommunicated to you, [O men!]" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent thee byinspiration: then wouldst thou find none to plead thy affair in that matter asagainst Us,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  Except for Mercy from thy Lord: for his bounty is to thee [indeed] great. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  Say: "If the whole of mankind and Jinns were to gather together to producethe like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if theybacked up each other with help and support. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  And We have explained to man, in this Qur'an, every kind of similitude: yetthe greater part of men refuse [to receive it] except with ingratitude! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  They say: "We shall not believe in thee, until thou cause a spring to gushforth for us from the earth, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  "Or [until] thou have a garden of date trees and vines, and cause rivers togush forth in their midst, carrying abundant water; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  "Or thou cause the sky to fall in pieces, as thou sayest [will happen],against us; or thou bring Allah and the angels before [us] face to face: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  "Or thou have a house adorned with gold, or thou mount a ladder right intothe skies. No, we shall not even believe in thy mounting until thou send down tous a book that we could read." Say: "Glory to my Lord! Am I aught but a man,- amessenger?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  What kept men back from belief when Guidance came to them, was nothing butthis: they said, "Has Allah sent a man [like us] to be [His] Messenger?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  Say, "If there were settled, on earth, angels walking about in peace andquiet, We should certainly have sent them down from the heavens an angel for amessenger." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  Say: "Enough is Allah for a witness between me and you: for He is wellacquainted with His servants, and He sees [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">97.  It is he whom Allah guides, that is on true Guidance; but he whom He leavesastray - for such wilt thou find no protector besides Him. On the Day ofJudgment We shall gather, them together, prone on their faces, blind, dumb, and </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">deaf: their abode will be Hell: every time it shows abatement, We shall increasefrom them the fierceness of the Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">98.  That is their recompense, because they rejected Our signs, and said, "Whenwe are reduced to bones and broken dust, should we really be raised up [to be] anew Creation?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">99.  See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, has power tocreate the like of them [anew]? Only He has decreed a term appointed, of whichthere is no doubt. But the unjust refuse [to receive it] except withingratitude. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">100.  Say: "If ye had control of the Treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, behold,ye would keep them back, for fear of spending them: for man is [every]niggardly!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">101.  To Moses We did give Nine Clear Signs: As the Children of Israel: when hecame to them, Pharaoh said to him: "O Moses! I consider thee, indeed, to havebeen worked upon by sorcery! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">102.  Moses said, "Thou knowest well that these things have been sent down bynone but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence: and Iconsider thee indeed, O Pharaoh, to be one doomed to destruction!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">103.  So he resolved to remove them from the face of the earth: but We did drown him and all who were with him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">104.  And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, "Dwell securely in theland [of promise]": but when the second of the warnings came to pass, Wegathered you together in a mingled crowd. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">105.  We sent down the [Qur'an] in Truth, and in Truth has it descended: and Wesent thee but to give Glad Tidings and to warn [sinners]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">106.  [It is] a Qur'an which We have divided [into parts from time to time], inorder that thou mightest recite it to men at intervals: We have revealed it bystages. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">107.  Say: "Whether ye believe in it or not, it is true that those who were givenknowledge beforehand, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces inhumble prostration, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">108.  "And they say: 'Glory to our Lord! Truly has the promise of our Lord beenfulfilled!'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">109.  They fall down on their faces in tears, and it increases their [earnest]humility. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">110.  Say: "Call upon Allah, or call upon Rahman: by whatever name ye call uponHim, [it is well]: for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Neither speak thyPrayer aloud, nor speak it in a low tone, but seek a middle course between." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">111.  Say: "Praise be to Allah, who begets no son, and has no partner in [His]dominion: Nor [needs] He any to protect Him from humiliation: yea, magnify Himfor His greatness and glory!" </p>
