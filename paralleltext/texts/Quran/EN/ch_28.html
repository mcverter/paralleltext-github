<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 28. Qasas, or Narration </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Ta. Sin. Mim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  These are Verses of the Book that makes [things] clear. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth, forpeople who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people intosections, depressing a small group among them: their sons he slew, but he keptalive their females: for he was indeed a maker of mischief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land,to make them leaders [in Faith] and make them heirs, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  To establish a firm place for them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Haman,and their hosts, at their hands, the very things against which they were takingprecautions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: "Suckle [thy child], butwhen thou hast fears about him, cast him into the river, but fear not nor </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">grieve: for We shall restore him to thee, and We shall make him one of Ourmessengers." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">8.  Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up [from the river]: [It was intended]that [Moses] should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for Pharaohand Haman and [all] their hosts were men of sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">9.  The wife of Pharaoh said: "[Here is] joy of the eye, for me and for thee:slay him not. It may be that he will be use to us, or we may adopt him as ason." And they perceived not [what they were doing]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">10.  But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses: She was going almost to disclose his [case], had We not strengthened her heart [withfaith], so that she might remain a [firm] believer. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">11.  And she said to the sister of [Moses], "Follow him" so she [the sister]watched him in the character of a stranger. And they knew not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">12.  And we ordained that he refused suck at first, until [His sister came upand] said: "Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish andbring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him?"... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">13.  Thus did We restore him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted, thatshe might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true:but most of them do not understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">14.  When he reached full age, and was firmly established [in life], We bestowedon him wisdom and knowledge: for thus do We reward those who do good. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">15.  And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching: and hefound there two men fighting,- one of his own religion, and the other, of hisfoes. Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe, and Mosesstruck him with his fist and made an end of him. He said: "This is a work of Evil [Satan]: for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">16.  He prayed: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgiveme!" So [Allah] forgave him: for He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">17.  He said: "O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me, nevershall I be a help to those who sin!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">18.  So he saw the morning in the city, looking about, in a state of fear, whenbehold, the man who had, the day before, sought his help called aloud for hishelp [again]. Moses said to him: "Thou art truly, it is clear, a quarrelsomefellow!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">19.  Then, when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both ofthem, that man said: "O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest aman yesterday? Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful violent manin the land, and not to be one who sets things right!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">20.  And there came a man, running, from the furthest end of the City. He said:"O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee, to slay thee: soget thee away, for I do give thee sincere advice." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">21.  He therefore got away therefrom, looking about, in a state of fear. Heprayed "O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">22.  Then, when he turned his face towards [the land of] Madyan, he said: "I dohope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">23.  And when he arrived at the watering [place] in Madyan, he found there agroup of men watering [their flocks], and besides them he found two women whowere keeping back [their flocks]. He said: "What is the matter with you?" They </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">said: "We cannot water [our flocks] until the shepherds take back [theirflocks]: And our father is a very old man." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">24.  So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he turned back to the shade, andsaid: O my Lord! truly am I in [desperate] need of any good that Thou dost sendme!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">25.  Afterwards one of the [damsels] came [back] to him, walking bashfully. Shesaid: "My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered [ourflocks] for us." So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said: "Fearthou not: [well] hast thou escaped from unjust people." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">26.  Said one of the [damsels]: "O my [dear] father! engage him on wages: trulythe best of men for thee to employ is the [man] who is strong and trusty".... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">27.  He said: "I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee, on conditionthat thou serve me for eight years; but if thou complete ten years, it will be[grace] from thee. But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty: thou wiltfind me, indeed, if Allah wills, one of the righteous." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">28.  He said: "Be that [the agreement] between me and thee: whichever of the twoterms I fulfil, let there be no ill-will to me. Be Allah a witness to what wesay." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">29.  Now when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family,he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: "Tarryye; I perceive a fire; I hope to bring you from there some information, or aburning firebrand, that ye may warm yourselves." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">30.  But when he came to the [fire], a voice was heard from the right bank of thevalley, from a tree in hallowed ground: "O Moses! Verily I am Allah, the Lord ofthe Worlds.... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">31.  "Now do thou throw thy rod!" but when he saw it moving [of its own accord]as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not hissteps: O Moses!" [It was said], "Draw near, and fear not: for thou art of thosewho are secure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">32.  "Move thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain[or harm], and draw thy hand close to thy side [to guard] against fear. Thoseare the two credentials from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: for truly theyare a people rebellious and wicked." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">33.  He said: "O my Lord! I have slain a man among them, and I fear lest theyslay me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">34.  "And my brother Aaron - He is more eloquent in speech than I: so send himwith me as a helper, to confirm [and strengthen] me: for I fear that they mayaccuse me of falsehood." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">35.  He said: "We will certainly strengthen thy arm through thy brother, andinvest you both with authority, so they shall not be able to touch you: with OurSign shall ye triumph,- you two as well as those who follow you." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">36.  When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said: "This is nothingbut sorcery faked up: never did we head the like among our fathers of old!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">37.  Moses said: "My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Himand whose end will be best in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doerswill not prosper." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">38.  Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs! no god do I know for you but myself: therefore, OHaman! light me a [kiln to bake bricks] out of clay, and build me a lofty </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">palace, that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but as far as I am concerned, Ithink [Moses] is a liar!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">39.  And he was arrogant and insolent in the land, beyond reason,- He and hishosts: they thought that they would not have to return to Us! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">40.  So We seized him and his hosts, and We flung them into the sea: Now beholdwhat was the end of those who did wrong! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">41.  And we made them [but] leaders inviting to the Fire; and on the Day ofJudgment no help shall they find. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">42.  in this world We made a curse to follow them and on the Day of Judgment theywill be among the loathed [and despised]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">43.  We did reveal to Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earliergenerations, [to give] Insight to men, and guidance and Mercy, that they mightreceive admonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">44.  Thou wast not on the Western side when We decreed the Commission to Moses,nor wast thou a witness [of those events]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">45.  But We raised up [new] generations, and long were the ages that passed overthem; but thou wast not a dweller among the people of Madyan, rehearsing OurSigns to them; but it is We Who send messengers [with inspiration]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">46.  Nor wast thou at the side of [the Mountain of] Tur when we called [toMoses]. Yet [art thou sent] as Mercy from thy Lord, to give warning to a peopleto whom no warner had come before thee: in order that they may receiveadmonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">47.  If [We had] not [sent thee to the Quraish],- in case a calamity should seizethem for [the deeds] that their hands have sent forth, they might say: "OurLord! why didst Thou not sent us a messenger? We should then have followed ThySigns and been amongst those who believe!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">48.  But [now], when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, "Whyare not [Signs] sent to him, like those which were sent to Moses?" Do they notthen reject [the Signs] which were formerly sent to Moses? They say: "Two kindsof sorcery, each assisting the other!" And they say: "For us, we reject all[such things]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">49.  Say: "Then bring ye a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than eitherof them, that I may follow it! [do], if ye are truthful!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">50.  But if they hearken not to thee, know that they only follow their own lusts:and who is more astray than one who follow his own lusts, devoid of guidancefrom Allah? for Allah guides not people given to wrong-doing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">51.  Now have We caused the Word to reach them themselves, in order that they mayreceive admonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">52.  Those to whom We sent the Book before this,- they do believe in this[revelation]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">53.  And when it is recited to them, they say: "We believe therein, for it is theTruth from our Lord: indeed we have been Muslims [bowing to Allah's Will] frombefore this. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">54.  Twice will they be given their reward, for that they have persevered, thatthey avert Evil with Good, and that they spend [in charity] out of what We havegiven them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">55.  And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: "To us ourdeeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">56.  It is true thou wilt not be able to guide every one, whom thou lovest; butAllah guides those whom He will and He knows best those who receive guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">57.  They say: "If we were to follow the guidance with thee, we should besnatched away from our land." Have We not established for them a securesanctuary, to which are brought as tribute fruits of all kinds,- a provisionfrom Ourselves? but most of them understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">58.  And how many populations We destroyed, which exulted in their life [of easeand plenty]! now those habitations of theirs, after them, are deserted,- All buta [miserable] few! and We are their heirs! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">59.  Nor was thy Lord the one to destroy a population until He had sent to itscentre a messenger, rehearsing to them Our Signs; nor are We going to destroy apopulation except when its members practise iniquity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">60.  The [material] things which ye are given are but the conveniences of thislife and the glitter thereof; but that which is with Allah is better and moreenduring: will ye not then be wise? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">61.  Are [these two] alike?- one to whom We have made a goodly promise, and whois going to reach its [fulfilment], and one to whom We have given the goodthings of this life, but who, on the Day of Judgment, is to be among thosebrought up [for punishment]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">62.  That Day [Allah] will call to them, and say "Where are my 'partners'?- whomye imagined [to be such]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">63.  Those against whom the charge will be proved, will say: "Our Lord! These arethe ones whom we led astray: we led them astray, as we were astray ourselves: wefree ourselves [from them] in Thy presence: it was not us they worshipped." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">64.  It will be said [to them]: "Call upon your 'partners' [for help]" :they willcall upon them, but they will not listen to them; and they will see the Penalty[before them]; [how they will wish] 'if only they had been open to guidance!' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">65.  That Day [Allah] will call to them, and say: "What was the answer ye gave tothe messengers?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">66.  Then the [whole] story that Day will seem obscure to them [like light to theblind] and they will not be able [even] to question each other. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">67.  But any that [in this life] had repented, believed, and workedrighteousness, will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">68.  Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they [in thematter]: Glory to Allah! and far is He above the partners they ascribe [to Him]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">69.  And thy Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">70.  And He is Allah: There is no god but He. To Him be praise, at the first andat the last: for Him is the Command, and to Him shall ye [all] be brought back. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">71.  Say: See ye? If Allah were to make the night perpetual over you to the Dayof Judgment, what god is there other than Allah, who can give you enlightenment?Will ye not then hearken? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">72.  Say: See ye? If Allah were to make the day perpetual over you to the Day ofJudgment, what god is there other than Allah, who can give you a night in whichye can rest? Will ye not then see? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">73.  It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you Night and Day,- that ye mayrest therein, and that ye may seek of his Grace;- and in order that ye may begrateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">74.  The Day that He will call on them, He will say: "Where are my 'partners'?whom ye imagined [to be such]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">75.  And from each people shall We draw a witness, and We shall say: "Produceyour Proof": then shall they know that the Truth is in Allah [alone], and the[lies] which they invented will leave them in lurch. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">76.  Qarun was doubtless, of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towardsthem: such were the treasures We had bestowed on him that their very keys wouldhave been a burden to a body of strong men, behold, his people said to him:"Exult not, for Allah loveth not those who exult [in riches]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">77.  "But seek, with the [wealth] which Allah has bestowed on thee, the Home ofthe Hereafter, nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good, as Allahhas been good to thee, and seek not [occasions for] mischief in the land: forAllah loves not those who do mischief." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">78.  He said: "This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which Ihave." Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, before him, [whole]generations,- which were superior to him in strength and greater in the amount[of riches] they had collected? but the wicked are not called[immediately] toaccount for their sins. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">79.  So he went forth among his people in the [pride of his worldly] glitter.Said those whose aim is the Life of this World: "Oh! that we had the like of what Qarun has got! for he is truly a lord of mighty good fortune!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">80.  But those who had been granted [true] knowledge said: "Alas for you! Thereward of Allah [in the Hereafter] is best for those who believe and workrighteousness: but this none shall attain, save those who steadfastly persevere[in good]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">81.  Then We caused the earth to swallow up him and his house; and he had not[the least little] party to help him against Allah, nor could he defend himself. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">82.  And those who had envied his position the day before began to say on themorrow: "Ah! it is indeed Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it, toany of His servants He pleases! had it not been that Allah was gracious to us,He could have caused the earth to swallow us up! Ah! those who reject Allah willassuredly never prosper." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">83.  That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high­handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is [best] for the righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">84.  If any does good, the reward to him is better than his deed; but if any doesevil, the doers of evil are only punished [to the extent] of their deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">85.  Verily He Who ordained the Qur'an for thee, will bring thee back to thePlace of Return. Say: "My Lord knows best who it is that brings true guidance,and who is in manifest error." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">86.  And thou hadst not expected that the Book would be sent to thee except as aMercy from thy Lord: Therefore lend not thou support in any way to those whoreject [Allah's Message]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">87.  And let nothing keep thee back from the Signs of Allah after they have beenrevealed to thee: and invite [men] to thy Lord, and be not of the company ofthose who join gods with Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">88.  And call not, besides Allah, on another god. There is no god but He.Everything [that exists] will perish except His own Face. To Him belongs theCommand, and to Him will ye [all] be brought back. </p>
