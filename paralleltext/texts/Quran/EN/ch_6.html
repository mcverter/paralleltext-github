<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 6. Anam, or Cattle </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Praise be Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darknessand the light. Yet those who reject Faith hold [others] as equal, with theirGuardian-Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  He it is created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term [for you]. Andthere is in His presence another determined term; yet ye doubt withinyourselves! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth. He knoweth what ye hide, andwhat ye reveal, and He knoweth the [recompense] which ye earn [by your deeds]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  But never did a single one of the signs of their Lord reach them, but theyturned away therefrom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And now they reject the truth when it reaches them: but soon shall they learnthe reality of what they used to mock at. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  See they not how many of those before them We did destroy?- generations Wehad established on the earth, in strength such as We have not given to you - forwhom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave [fertile] streamsflowing beneath their [feet]: yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raisedin their wake fresh generations [to succeed them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  If We had sent unto thee a written [message] on parchment, so that they couldtouch it with their hands, the Unbelievers would have been sure to say: "This isnothing but obvious magic!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  They say: "Why is not an angel sent down to him?" If we did send down anangel, the matter would be settled at once, and no respite would be grantedthem. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  If We had made it an angel, We should have sent him as a man, and We shouldcertainly have caused them confusion in a matter which they have already coveredwith confusion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Mocked were [many] messengers before thee; but their scoffers were hemmed inby the thing that they mocked. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Say: "Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those whorejected Truth." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Say: "To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "ToAllah. He hath inscribed for Himself [the rule of] Mercy. That He will gatheryou together for the Day of Judgment, there is no doubt whatever. It is they whohave lost their own souls, that will not believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  To him belongeth all that dwelleth [or lurketh] in the night and the day.For he is the one who heareth and knoweth all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Say: "Shall I take for my protector any other than Allah, the Maker of theheavens and the earth? And He it is that feedeth but is not fed." Say: "Nay! butI am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah [in Islam], and be notthou of the company of those who join gods with Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Say: "I would, if I disobeyed my Lord, indeed have fear of the penalty of aMighty Day. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  "On that day, if the penalty is averted from any, it is due to Allah'smercy; And that would be [Salvation], the obvious fulfilment of all desire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  "If Allah touch thee with affliction, none can remove it but He; if He touchthee with happiness, He hath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  "He is the irresistible, [watching] from above over His worshippers; and Heis the Wise, acquainted with all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Say: "What thing is most weighty in evidence?" Say: "Allah is witnessbetween me and you; This Qur'an hath been revealed to me by inspiration, that Imay warn you and all whom it reaches. Can ye possibly bear witness that besidesAllah there is another Allah?" Say: "Nay! I cannot bear witness!" Say: "But intruth He is the one Allah, and I truly am innocent of [your blasphemy of]joining others with Him." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons.Those who have lost their own souls refuse therefore to believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Who doth more wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or rejectethHis signs? But verily the wrong-doers never shall prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  One day shall We gather them all together: We shall say to those whoascribed partners [to Us]: "Where are the partners whom ye [invented and] talkedabout?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  There will then be [left] no subterfuge for them but to say: "By Allah ourLord, we were not those who joined gods with Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Behold! how they lie against their own souls! But the [lie] which theyinvented will leave them in the lurch. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Of them there are some who [pretend to] listen to thee; but We have thrownveils on their hearts, So they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; ifthey saw every one of the signs, not they will believe in them; in so much thatwhen they come to thee, they [but] dispute with thee; the Unbelievers say:"These are nothing but tales of the ancients." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Others they keep away from it, and themselves they keep away; but they onlydestroy their own souls, and they perceive it not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the Fire! They willsay: "Would that we were but sent back! Then would we not reject the signs ofour Lord, but would be amongst those who believe!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Yea, in their own [eyes] will become manifest what before they concealed.But if they were returned, they would certainly relapse to the things they wereforbidden, for they are indeed liars. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  And they [sometimes] say: "There is nothing except our life on this earth,and never shall we be raised up again." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with their Lord! He willsay: "Is not this the truth?" They will say: "Yea, by our Lord!" He will say:"Taste ye then the penalty, because ye rejected Faith." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Lost indeed are they who treat it as a falsehood that they must meet Allah,-until on a sudden the hour is on them, and they say: "Ah! woe unto us that wetook no thought of it"; for they bear their burdens on their backs, and evilindeed are the burdens that they bear? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  What is the life of this world but play and amusement? But best is the homein the hereafter, for those who are righteous. Will ye not then understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  We know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee: It is not theethey reject: it is the signs of Allah, which the wicked contemn. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Rejected were the messengers before thee: with patience and constancy theybore their rejection and their wrongs, until Our aid did reach them: there isnone that can alter the words [and decrees] of Allah. Already hast thou receivedsome account of those messengers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  If their spurning is hard on thy mind, yet if thou wert able to seek atunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign,- [whatgood?]. If it were Allah's will, He could gather them together unto trueguidance: so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance [andimpatience]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Those who listen [in truth], be sure, will accept: as to the dead, Allahwill raise them up; then will they be turned unto Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Allahhath certainly power to send down a sign: but most of them understand not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  There is not an animal [that lives] on the earth, nor a being that flies onits wings, but [forms part of] communities like you. Nothing have we omittedfrom the Book, and they [all] shall be gathered to their Lord in the end. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  Those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb,- in the midst of darknessprofound: whom Allah willeth, He leaveth to wander: whom He willeth, He placethon the way that is straight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Say: "Think ye to yourselves, if there come upon you the wrath of Allah, orthe Hour [that ye dread], would ye then call upon other than Allah?- [reply] ifye are truthful! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  "Nay,- On Him would ye call, and if it be His will, He would remove [thedistress] which occasioned your call upon Him, and ye would forget [the falsegods] which ye join with Him!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Before thee We sent [messengers] to many nations, and We afflicted thenations with suffering and adversity, that they might learn humility. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  When the suffering reached them from us, why then did they not learnhumility? On the contrary their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their[sinful] acts seem alluring to them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  But when they forgot the warning they had received, We opened to them thegates of all [good] things, until, in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts,on a sudden, We called them to account, when lo! they were plunged in despair! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Of the wrong-doers the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to Allah, theCherisher of the worlds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Say: "Think ye, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealedup your hearts, who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you?" Seehow We explain the signs by various [symbols]; yet they turn aside. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Say: "Think ye, if the punishment of Allah comes to you, whether suddenly oropenly, will any be destroyed except those who do wrong? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those whobelieve and mend [their lives],- upon them shall be no fear, nor shall theygrieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  But those who reject our signs,- them shall punishment touch, for that theyceased not from transgressing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  Say: "I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I knowwhat is hidden, nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealedto me." Say: "can the blind be held equal to the seeing?" Will ye then considernot? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  Give this warning to those in whose [hearts] is the fear that they will bebrought [to judgment] before their Lord: except for Him they will have noprotector nor intercessor: that they may guard [against evil]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking Hisface. In naught art thou accountable for them, and in naught are theyaccountable for thee, that thou shouldst turn them away, and thus be [one] ofthe unjust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others, that they shouldsay: "Is it these then that Allah hath favoured from amongst us?" Doth not Allahknow best those who are grateful? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  When those come to thee who believe in Our signs, Say: "Peace be on you:Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself [the rule of] mercy: verily, if any of youdid evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented, and amend [his conduct], lo! Heis Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  Thus do We explain the signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may beshown up. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  Say: "I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye callupon." Say: "I will not follow your wain desires: If I did, I would stray fromthe path, and be not of the company of those who receive guidance." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  Say: "For me, I [work] on a clear sign from my Lord, but ye reject Him. Whatye would see hastened, is not in my power. The command rests with none butAllah: He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  Say: "If what ye would see hastened were in my power, the matter would besettled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none knoweth but He.He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness [or depths] of theearth, nor anything fresh or dry [green or withered], but is [inscribed] in arecord clear [to those who can read]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">60.  It is He who doth take your souls by night, and hath knowledge of all thatye have done by day: by day doth He raise you up again; that a term appointed befulfilled; In the end unto Him will be your return; then will He show you thetruth of all that ye did. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">61.  He is the irresistible, [watching] from above over His worshippers, and Hesets guardians over you. At length, when death approaches one of you, Our angelstake his soul, and they never fail in their duty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">62.  Then are men returned unto Allah, their protector, the [only] reality: Isnot His the command? and He is the swiftest in taking account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">63.  Say: "Who is it that delivereth you from the dark recesses of land and sea,when ye call upon Him in humility and silent terror: 'If He only delivers usfrom these [dangers], [we vow] we shall truly show our gratitude'?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">64.  Say "It is Allah that delivereth you from these and all [other] distresses:and yet ye worship false gods!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">65.  Say: "He hath power to send calamities on you, from above and below, or tocover you with confusion in party strife, giving you a taste of mutual vengeance</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">-each from the other." See how We explain the signs by various [symbols]; thatthey may understand.  66.  But thy people reject this, though it is the truth. Say: "Not mine is theresponsibility for arranging your affairs; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">67.  For every message is a limit of time, and soon shall ye know it." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">68.  When thou seest men engaged in vain discourse about Our signs, turn awayfrom them unless they turn to a different theme. If Satan ever makes theeforget, then after recollection, sit not thou in the company of those who dowrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">69.  On their account no responsibility falls on the righteous, but [their duty]is to remind them, that they may [learn to] fear Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">70.  Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement, andare deceived by the life of this world. But proclaim [to them] this [truth]:that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts: it will find for itselfno protector or intercessor except Allah: if it offered every ransom, [orreparation], none will be accepted: such is [the end of] those who deliverthemselves to ruin by their own acts: they will have for drink [only] boilingwater, and for punishment, one most grievous: for they persisted in rejectingAllah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">71.  Say: "Shall we indeed call on others besides Allah,- things that can do usneither good nor harm,- and turn on our heels after receiving guidance fromAllah? - like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool, wandering bewilderedthrough the earth, his friends calling, come to us', [vainly] guiding him to thepath." Say: "Allah's guidance is the [only] guidance, and we have been directedto submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">72.  "To establish regular prayers and to fear Allah: for it is to Him that weshall be gathered together." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">73.  It is He who created the heavens and the earth in true [proportions]: theday He saith, "Be," behold! it is. His word is the truth. His will be the </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">dominion the day the trumpet will be blown. He knoweth the unseen as well asthat which is open. For He is the Wise, well acquainted [with all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">74.  Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar: "Takest thou idols for gods? For I seethee and thy people in manifest error." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">75.  So also did We show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and theearth, that he might [with understanding] have certitude. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">76.  When the night covered him over, He saw a star: He said: "This is my Lord."But when it set, He said: "I love not those that set." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">77.  When he saw the moon rising in splendour, he said: "This is my Lord." Butwhen the moon set, He said: "unless my Lord guide me, I shall surely be amongthose who go astray." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">78.  When he saw the sun rising in splendour, he said: "This is my Lord; this isthe greatest [of all]." But when the sun set, he said: "O my people! I am indeedfree from your [guilt] of giving partners to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">79.  "For me, I have set my face, firmly and truly, towards Him Who created theheavens and the earth, and never shall I give partners to Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">80.  His people disputed with him. He said: "[Come] ye to dispute with me, aboutAllah, when He [Himself] hath guided me? I fear not [the beings] ye associatewith Allah: Unless my Lord willeth, [nothing can happen]. My Lord comprehendethin His knowledge all things. Will ye not [yourselves] be admonished? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">81.  "How should I fear [the beings] ye associate with Allah, when ye fear not togive partners to Allah without any warrant having been given to you? Which of[us] two parties hath more right to security? [tell me] if ye know. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">82.  "It is those who believe and confuse not their beliefs with wrong - that are[truly] in security, for they are on [right] guidance." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">83.  That was the reasoning about Us, which We gave to Abraham [to use] againsthis people: We raise whom We will, degree after degree: for thy Lord is full ofwisdom and knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">84.  We gave him Isaac and Jacob: all [three] guided: and before him, We guidedNoah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron: thusdo We reward those who do good: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">85.  And Zakariya and John, and Jesus and Elias: all in the ranks of therighteous: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">86.  And Isma'il and Elisha, and Jonas, and Lot: and to all We gave favour abovethe nations: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">87.  [To them] and to their fathers, and progeny and brethren: We chose them, andwe guided them to a straight way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">88.  This is the guidance of Allah: He giveth that guidance to whom He pleaseth,of His worshippers. If they were to join other gods with Him, all that they didwould be vain for them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">89.  These were the men to whom We gave the Book, and authority, and prophethood:if these [their descendants] reject them, Behold! We shall entrust their chargeto a new people who reject them not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">90.  Those were the [prophets] who received Allah's guidance: Copy the guidancethey received; Say: "No reward for this do I ask of you: This is no less than amessage for the nations." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">91.  No just estimate of Allah do they make when they say: "Nothing doth Allahsend down to man [by way of revelation]" Say: "Who then sent down the Book whichMoses brought?- a light and guidance to man: But ye make it into [separate]sheets for show, while ye conceal much [of its contents]: therein were ye taughtthat which ye knew not- neither ye nor your fathers." Say: "Allah [sent itdown]": Then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">92.  And this is a Book which We have sent down, bringing blessings, andconfirming [the revelations] which came before it: that thou mayest warn themother of cities and all around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this [Book], and they are constant in guarding their prayers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">93.  Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against Allah, or saith,"I have received inspiration," when he hath received none, or [again] who saith,"I can reveal the like of what Allah hath revealed"? If thou couldst but see how the wicked [do fare] in the flood of confusion at death! - the angels stretchforth their hands, [saying],"Yield up your souls: this day shall ye receive yourreward,- a penalty of shame, for that ye used to tell lies against Allah, andscornfully to reject of His signs!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">94.  "And behold! ye come to us bare and alone as We created you for the firsttime: ye have left behind you all [the favours] which We bestowed on you: We seenot with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs:so now all relations between you have been cut off, and your [pet] fancies haveleft you in the lurch!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">95.  It is Allah Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split andsprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to causethe dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded awayfrom the truth? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">96.  He it is that cleaveth the day-break [from the dark]: He makes the night forrest and tranquillity, and the sun and moon for the reckoning [of time]: Such isthe judgment and ordering of [Him], the Exalted in Power, the Omniscient. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">97.  It is He Who maketh the stars [as beacons] for you, that ye may guideyourselves, with their help, through the dark spaces of land and sea: We detailOur signs for people who know. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">98.  It is He Who hath produced you from a single person: here is a place ofsojourn and a place of departure: We detail Our signs for people who understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">99.  It is He Who sendeth down rain from the skies: with it We produce vegetationof all kinds: from some We produce green [crops], out of which We produce grain,heaped up [at harvest]; out of the date-palm and its sheaths [or spathes] [come]clusters of dates hanging low and near: and [then there are] gardens of grapes,and olives, and pomegranates, each similar [in kind] yet different [in variety]:when they begin to bear fruit, feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripenessthereof. Behold! in these things there are signs for people who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">100.  Yet they make the Jinns equals with Allah, though Allah did create theJinns; and they falsely, having no knowledge, attribute to Him sons anddaughters. Praise and glory be to Him! [for He is] above what they attribute toHim! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">101.  To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: How can Hehave a son when He hath no consort? He created all things, and He hath fullknowledge of all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">102.  That is Allah, your Lord! there is no god but He, the Creator of allthings: then worship ye Him: and He hath power to dispose of all affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">103.  No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is above allcomprehension, yet is acquainted with all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">104.  "Now have come to you, from your Lord, proofs [to open your eyes]: if anywill see, it will be for [the good of] his own soul; if any will be blind, itwill be to his own [harm]: I am not [here] to watch over your doings." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">105.  Thus do we explain the signs by various [symbols]: that they may say, "Thouhast taught [us] diligently," and that We may make the matter clear to those whoknow. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">106.  Follow what thou art taught by inspiration from thy Lord: there is no godbut He: and turn aside from those who join gods with Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">107.  If it had been Allah's plan, they would not have taken false gods: but Wemade thee not one to watch over their doings, nor art thou set over them todispose of their affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">108.  Revile not ye those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they out ofspite revile Allah in their ignorance. Thus have We made alluring to each peopleits own doings. In the end will they return to their Lord, and We shall thentell them the truth of all that they did. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">109.  They swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if a [special] sign came tothem, by it they would believe. Say: "Certainly [all] signs are in the power ofAllah: but what will make you [Muslims] realise that [even] if [special] signscame, they will not believe."? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">110.  We [too] shall turn to [confusion] their hearts and their eyes, even asthey refused to believe in this in the first instance: We shall leave them intheir trespasses, to wander in distraction. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">111.  Even if We did send unto them angels, and the dead did speak unto them, andWe gathered together all things before their very eyes, they are not the ones tobelieve, unless it is in Allah's plan. But most of them ignore [the truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">112.  Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy,- evil ones among men andjinns, inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thyLord had so planned, they would not have done it: so leave them and theirinventions alone. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">113.  To such [deceit] let the hearts of those incline, who have no faith in thehereafter: let them delight in it, and let them earn from it what they may. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">114.  Say: "Shall I seek for judge other than Allah? - when He it is Who hathsent unto you the Book, explained in detail." They know full well, to whom Wehave given the Book, that it hath been sent down from thy Lord in truth. Neverbe then of those who doubt. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">115.  The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment in truth and in justice: Nonecan change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">116.  Wert thou to follow the common run of those on earth, they will lead theeaway from the way of Allah. They follow nothing but conjecture: they do nothingbut lie. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">117.  Thy Lord knoweth best who strayeth from His way: He knoweth best who theyare that receive His guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">118.  So eat of [meats] on which Allah's name hath been pronounced, if ye havefaith in His signs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="122">119.  Why should ye not eat of [meats] on which Allah's name hath beenpronounced, when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you -</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">except under compulsion of necessity? But many do mislead [men] by theirappetites unchecked by knowledge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">120.  Eschew all sin, open or secret: those who earn sin will get due recompensefor their "earnings." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="125">121.  Eat not of [meats] on which Allah's name hath not been pronounced: Thatwould be impiety. But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend withyou if ye were to obey them, ye would indeed be Pagans. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="126">122.  Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a light whereby he can walkamongst men, be like him who is in the depths of darkness, from which he cannever come out? Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="127">123.  Thus have We placed leaders in every town, its wicked men, to plot [andburrow] therein: but they only plot against their own souls, and they perceiveit not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="128">124.  When there comes to them a sign [from Allah], They say: "We shall notbelieve until we receive one [exactly] like those received by Allah'smessengers." Allah knoweth best where [and how] to carry out His mission. Soonwill the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before Allah, and a severepunishment, for all their plots. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="129">125.  Those whom Allah [in His plan] willeth to guide,- He openeth their breastto Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying,- He maketh their breast closeand constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah [heap]the penalty on those who refuse to believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="130">126.  This is the way of thy Lord, leading straight: We have detailed the signsfor those who receive admonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="131">127.  For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will betheir friend, because they practised [righteousness]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="132">128.  One day will He gather them all together, [and say]: "O ye assembly ofJinns! Much [toll] did ye take of men." Their friends amongst men will say: "OurLord! we made profit from each other: but [alas!] we reached our term - whichthou didst appoint for us." He will say: "The Fire be your dwelling-place: youwill dwell therein for ever, except as Allah willeth." for thy Lord is full ofwisdom and knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="133">129.  Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other, because of what theyearn. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="134">130.  "O ye assembly of Jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers fromamongst you, setting forth unto you My signs, and warning you of the meeting ofthis Day of yours?" They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves." It wasthe life of this world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bearwitness that they rejected Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="135">131.  [The messengers were sent] thus, for thy Lord would not destroy for theirwrong-doing men's habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="136">132.  To all are degrees [or ranks] according to their deeds: for thy Lord is notunmindful of anything that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="137">133.  Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were His will, He coulddestroy you, and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors, even asHe raised you up from the posterity of other people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="138">134.  All that hath been promised unto you will come to pass: nor can yefrustrate it [in the least bit]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="139">135.  Say: "O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do [my part]: soon will yeknow who it is whose end will be [best] in the Hereafter: certain it is that thewrong-doers will not prosper." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="140">136.  Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle, theyassigned Him a share: they say, according to their fancies: "This is for Allah,and this" - for our "partners"! but the share of their" partners "reacheth notAllah, whilst the share of Allah reacheth their "partners"! evil [and unjust] istheir assignment! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="141">137.  Even so, in the eyes of most of the pagans, their "partners" made alluringthe slaughter of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction,and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed, they would not havedone so: But leave alone them and their inventions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="142">138.  And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo, and none shouldeat of them except those whom - so they say - We wish; further, there are cattleforbidden to yoke or burden, and cattle on which, [at slaughter], the name ofAllah is not pronounced; - inventions against Allah's name: soon will He requitethem for their inventions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="143">139.  They say: "What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is speciallyreserved [for food] for our men, and forbidden to our women; but if it is still­born, then all have share therein. For their [false] attribution [ofsuperstitions to Allah], He will soon punish them: for He is full of wisdom andknowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="144">140.  Lost are those who slay their children, from folly, without knowledge, andforbid food which Allah hath provided for them, inventing [lies] against Allah.They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="145">141.  It is He Who produceth gardens, with trellises and without, and dates, andtilth with produce of all kinds, and olives and pomegranates, similar [in kind]and different [in variety]: eat of their fruit in their season, but render thedues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered. But waste not byexcess: for Allah loveth not the wasters. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="146">142.  Of the cattle are some for burden and some for meat: eat what Allah hath provided for you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan: for he is to you andavowed enemy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="147">143.  [Take] eight [head of cattle] in [four] pairs: of sheep a pair, and ofgoats a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or [theyoung] which the wombs of the two females enclose? Tell me with knowledge if yeare truthful: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="148">144.  Of camels a pair, and oxen a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, orthe two females, or [the young] which the wombs of the two females enclose? -Were ye present when Allah ordered you such a thing? But who doth more wrongthan one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead astray men without knowledge?For Allah guideth not people who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="149">145.  Say: "I find not in the message received by me by inspiration any [meat]forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be dead meat, orblood poured forth, or the flesh of swine,- for it is an abomination - or, whatis impious, [meat] on which a name has been invoked, other than Allah's". But[even so], if a person is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nortransgressing due limits,- thy Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="150">146.  For those who followed the Jewish Law, We forbade every [animal] withundivided hoof, and We forbade them that fat of the ox and the sheep, exceptwhat adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone: this </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="151">in recompense for their wilful disobedience: for We are true [in Ourordinances]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="152">147.  If they accuse thee of falsehood, say: "Your Lord is full of mercy all-embracing; but from people in guilt never will His wrath be turned back. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="153">148.  Those who give partners [to Allah] will say: "If Allah had wished, weshould not have given partners to Him nor would our fathers; nor should we havehad any taboos." So did their ancestors argue falsely, until they tasted of Ourwrath. Say: "Have ye any [certain] knowledge? If so, produce it before us. Yefollow nothing but conjecture: ye do nothing but lie." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="154">149.  Say: "With Allah is the argument that reaches home: if it had been Hiswill, He could indeed have guided you all." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="155">150.  Say: "Bring forward your witnesses to prove that Allah did forbid so andso." If they bring such witnesses, be not thou amongst them: Nor follow thou thevain desires of such as treat our signs as falsehoods, and such as believe notin the Hereafter: for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="156">151.  Say: "Come, I will rehearse what Allah hath [really] prohibited you from":Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not yourchildren on a plea of want;- We provide sustenance for you and for them;- comenot nigh to shameful deeds. Whether open or secret; take not life, which Allahhath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you,that ye may learn wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="157">152.  And come not nigh to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until heattain the age of full strength; give measure and weight with [full] justice;-no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever yespeak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfil thecovenant of Allah: thus doth He command you, that ye may remember. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="158">153.  Verily, this is My way, leading straight: follow it: follow not [other]paths: they will scatter you about from His [great] path: thus doth He commandyou. that ye may be righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="159">154.  Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing [Our favour] to those whowould do right, and explaining all things in detail,- and a guide and a mercy,that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="160">155.  And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing: so follow it andbe righteous, that ye may receive mercy: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="161">156.  Lest ye should say: "The Book was sent down to two Peoples before us, andfor our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduousstudy:" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="162">157.  Or lest ye should say: "If the Book had only been sent down to us, weshould have followed its guidance better than they." Now then hath come unto youa clear [sign] from your Lord,- and a guide and a mercy: then who could do morewrong than one who rejecteth Allah's signs, and turneth away therefrom? In goodtime shall We requite those who turn away from Our signs, with a dreadfulpenalty, for their turning away. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="163">158.  Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them, or thy Lord [Himself],or certain of the signs of thy Lord! the day that certain of the signs of thyLord do come, no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then if itbelieved not before nor earned righteousness through its faith. Say: "Wait ye:we too are waiting." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="164">159.  As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, thou hastno part in them in the least: their affair is with Allah: He will in the endtell them the truth of all that they did. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="165">160.  He that doeth good shall have ten times as much to his credit: He thatdoeth evil shall only be recompensed according to his evil: no wrong shall bedone unto [any of] them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="166">161.  Say: "Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight,- a religionof right,- the path [trod] by Abraham the true in Faith, and he [certainly]joined not gods with Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="167">162.  Say: "Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death,are [all] for Allah, the Cherisher of the Worlds: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="168">163.  No partner hath He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those whobow to His will. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="169">164.  Say: "Shall I seek for [my] Cherisher other than Allah, when He is theCherisher of all things [that exist]? Every soul draws the meed of its acts onnone but itself: no bearer of burdens can bear of burdens can bear the burden of another. Your goal in the end is towards Allah: He will tell you the truth ofthe things wherein ye disputed." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="170">165.  It is He Who hath made you [His] agents, inheritors of the earth: He hathraised you in ranks, some above others: that He may try you in the gifts He hathgiven you: for thy Lord is quick in punishment: yet He is indeed Oft-forgiving,Most Merciful. </p>
