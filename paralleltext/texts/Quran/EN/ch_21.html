<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 21. Anbiyaa, or The Prophets </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Closer and closer to mankind comes their Reckoning: yet they heed not andthey turn away. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Never comes [aught] to them of a renewed Message from their Lord, but theylisten to it as in jest,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Their hearts toying as with trifles. The wrong-doers conceal their privatecounsels, [saying], "Is this [one] more than a man like yourselves? Will ye goto witchcraft with your eyes open?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Say: "My Lord knoweth [every] word [spoken] in the heavens and on earth: Heis the One that heareth and knoweth [all things]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  "Nay," they say, "[these are] medleys of dream! - Nay, He forged it! - Nay,He is [but] a poet! Let him then bring us a Sign like the ones that were sent to[Prophets] of old!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  [As to those] before them, not one of the populations which We destroyedbelieved: will these believe? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Before thee, also, the messengers We sent were but men, to whom We grantedinspiration: If ye realise this not, ask of those who possess the Message. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Nor did We give them bodies that ate no food, nor were they exempt fromdeath. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  In the end We fulfilled to them Our Promise, and We saved them and those whomWe pleased, but We destroyed those who transgressed beyond bounds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  We have revealed for you [O men!] a book in which is a Message for you: willye not then understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  How many were the populations We utterly destroyed because of theiriniquities, setting up in their places other peoples? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Yet, when they felt Our Punishment [coming], behold, they [tried to] fleefrom it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Flee not, but return to the good things of this life which were given you,and to your homes in order that ye may be called to account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  They said: "Ah! woe to us! We were indeed wrong-doers!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that ismown, as ashes silent and quenched. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Not for [idle] sport did We create the heavens and the earth and all that isbetween! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  If it had been Our wish to take [just] a pastime, We should surely havetaken it from the things nearest to Us, if We would do [such a thing]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Nay, We hurl the Truth against falsehood, and it knocks out its brain, andbehold, falsehood doth perish! Ah! woe be to you for the [false] things yeascribe [to Us]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  To Him belong all [creatures] in the heavens and on earth: Even those whoare in His [very] Presence are not too proud to serve Him, nor are they [ever]weary [of His service]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever flag or intermit. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Or have they taken [for worship] gods from the earth who can raise [thedead]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  If there were, in the heavens and the earth, other gods besides Allah, therewould have been confusion in both! but glory to Allah, the Lord of the Throne:[High is He] above what they attribute to Him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  He cannot be questioned for His acts, but they will be questioned [fortheirs]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Or have they taken for worship [other] gods besides him? Say, "Bring yourconvincing proof: this is the Message of those with me and the Message of thosebefore me." But most of them know not the Truth, and so turn away. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Not a messenger did We send before thee without this inspiration sent by Usto him: that there is no god but I; therefore worship and serve Me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And they say: "[Allah] Most Gracious has begotten offspring." Glory to Him!they are [but] servants raised to honour. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  They speak not before He speaks, and they act [in all things] by HisCommand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they offer nointercession except for those who are acceptable, and they stand in awe andreverence of His [Glory]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  If any of them should say, "I am a god besides Him", such a one We shouldreward with Hell: thus do We reward those who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joinedtogether [as one unit of creation], before we clove them asunder? We made fromwater every living thing. Will they not then believe? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  And We have set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shakewith them, and We have made therein broad highways [between mountains] for themto pass through: that they may receive Guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  And We have made the heavens as a canopy well guarded: yet do they turn awayfrom the Signs which these things [point to]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  It is He Who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon: all[the celestial bodies] swim along, each in its rounded course. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  We granted not to any man before thee permanent life [here]: if then thoushouldst die, would they live permanently? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Every soul shall have a taste of death: and We test you by evil and by goodby way of trial. to Us must ye return. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  When the Unbelievers see thee, they treat thee not except with ridicule. "Isthis," [they say], "the one who talks of your gods?" and they blaspheme at themention of [Allah] Most Gracious! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Man is a creature of haste: soon [enough] will I show you My Signs; then yewill not ask Me to hasten them! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  They say: "When will this promise come to pass, if ye are telling thetruth?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  If only the Unbelievers knew [the time] when they will not be able to wardoff the fire from their faces, nor yet from their backs, and [when] no help canreach them! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Nay, it may come to them all of a sudden and confound them: no power willthey have then to avert it, nor will they [then] get respite. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Mocked were [many] messenger before thee; But their scoffers were hemmed inby the thing that they mocked. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Say: "Who can keep you safe by night and by day from [the Wrath of] [Allah]Most Gracious?" Yet they turn away from the mention of their Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  Or have they gods that can guard them from Us? They have no power to aidthemselves, nor can they be defended from Us. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Nay, We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathersuntil the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce theland [in their control] from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Say, "I do but warn you according to revelation": But the deaf will not hearthe call, [even] when they are warned! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  If but a breath of the Wrath of thy Lord do touch them, they will then say,"Woe to us! we did wrong indeed!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  We shall set up scales of justice for the Day of Judgment, so that not asoul will be dealt with unjustly in the least, and if there be [no more than]the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it [to account]: and enough are Weto take account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  In the past We granted to Moses and Aaron the criterion [for judgment], anda Light and a Message for those who would do right,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Those who fear their Lord in their most secret thoughts, and who hold theHour [of Judgment] in awe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  And this is a blessed Message which We have sent down: will ye then rejectit? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  We bestowed aforetime on Abraham his rectitude of conduct, and well were Weacquainted with him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  Behold! he said to his father and his people, "What are these images, towhich ye are [so assiduously] devoted?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  They said, "We found our fathers worshipping them." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  He said, "Indeed ye have been in manifest error - ye and your fathers." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  They said, "Have you brought us the Truth, or are you one of those whojest?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  He said, "Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, He Whocreated them [from nothing]: and I am a witness to this [Truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  "And by Allah, I have a plan for your idols - after ye go away and turn yourbacks".. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  So he broke them to pieces, [all] but the biggest of them, that they mightturn [and address themselves] to it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He must indeed be some man ofimpiety!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  They said, "We heard a youth talk of them: He is called Abraham." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bearwitness." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  They said, "Art thou the one that did this with our gods, O Abraham?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  He said: "Nay, this was done by - this is their biggest one! ask them, ifthey can speak intelligently!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  So they turned to themselves and said, "Surely ye are the ones in thewrong!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  Then were they confounded with shame: [they said], "Thou knowest full wellthat these [idols] do not speak!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  [Abraham] said, "Do ye then worship, besides Allah, things that can neitherbe of any good to you nor do you harm? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  "Fie upon you, and upon the things that ye worship besides Allah! Have ye nosense?".. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  They said, "Burn him and protect your gods, If ye do [anything at all]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  We said, "O Fire! be thou cool, and [a means of] safety for Abraham!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  Then they sought a stratagem against him: but We made them the ones thatlost most! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  But We delivered him and [his nephew] Lut [and directed them] to the landwhich We have blessed for the nations. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, [a grandson],Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one [of them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  And We made them leaders, guiding [men] by Our Command, and We sent theminspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practiseregular charity; and they constantly served Us [and Us only]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  And to Lut, too, We gave Judgment and Knowledge, and We saved him from thetown which practised abominations: truly they were a people given to Evil, arebellious people. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  And We admitted him to Our Mercy: for he was one of the Righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  [Remember] Noah, when he cried [to Us] aforetime: We listened to his[prayer] and delivered him and his family from great distress. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  We helped him against people who rejected Our Signs: truly they were apeople given to Evil: so We drowned them [in the Flood] all together. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  And remember David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the matter of thefield into which the sheep of certain people had strayed by night: We didwitness their judgment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  To Solomon We inspired the [right] understanding of the matter: to each [ofthem] We gave Judgment and Knowledge; it was Our power that made the hills andthe birds celebrate Our praises, with David: it was We Who did [all thesethings]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail for your benefit, toguard you from each other's violence: will ye then be grateful? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  [It was Our power that made] the violent [unruly] wind flow [tamely] forSolomon, to his order, to the land which We had blessed: for We do know allthings. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  And of the evil ones, were some who dived for him, and did other workbesides; and it was We Who guarded them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  And [remember] Job, when He cried to his Lord, "Truly distress has seizedme, but Thou art the Most Merciful of those that are merciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  So We listened to him: We removed the distress that was on him, and Werestored his people to him, and doubled their number,- as a Grace fromOurselves, and a thing for commemoration, for all who serve Us. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  And [remember] Isma'il, Idris, and Zul-kifl, all [men] of constancy andpatience; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  And remember Zun-nun, when he departed in wrath: He imagined that We had nopower over him! But he cried through the depths of darkness, "There is no godbut thou: glory to thee: I was indeed wrong!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  So We listened to him: and delivered him from distress: and thus do We deliver those who have faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  And [remember] Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: "O my Lord! leave me notwithout offspring, though thou art the best of inheritors." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  So We listened to him: and We granted him Yahya: We cured his wife's[Barrenness] for him. These [three] were ever quick in emulation in good works;they used to call on Us with love and reverence, and humble themselves beforeUs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  And [remember] her who guarded her chastity: We breathed into her of Ourspirit, and We made her and her son a sign for all peoples. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  Verily, this brotherhood of yours is a single brotherhood, and I am yourLord and Cherisher: therefore serve Me [and no other]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  But [later generations] cut off their affair [of unity], one from another:[yet] will they all return to Us. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  Whoever works any act of righteousness and has faith,- His endeavour willnot be rejected: We shall record it in his favour. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  But there is a ban on any population which We have destroyed: that theyshall not return, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  Until the Gog and Magog [people] are let through [their barrier], and theyswiftly swarm from every hill. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">97.  Then will the true promise draw nigh [of fulfilment]: then behold! the eyesof the Unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror: "Ah! Woe to us! we were indeedheedless of this; nay, we truly did wrong!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">98.  Verily ye, [unbelievers], and the [false] gods that ye worship besidesAllah, are [but] fuel for Hell! to it will ye [surely] come! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">99.  If these had been gods, they would not have got there! but each one willabide therein. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">100.  There, sobbing will be their lot, nor will they there hear [aught else]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">101.  Those for whom the good [record] from Us has gone before, will be removedfar therefrom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">102.  Not the slightest sound will they hear of Hell: what their souls desired,in that will they dwell. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">103.  The Great Terror will bring them no grief: but the angels will meet them[with mutual greetings]: "This is your Day,- [the Day] that ye were promised." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">104.  The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books[completed],- even as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a newone: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfil it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">105.  Before this We wrote in the Psalms, after the Message [given to Moses]: Myservants the righteous, shall inherit the earth." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">106.  Verily in this [Qur'an] is a Message for people who would [truly] worshipAllah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">107.  We sent thee not, but as a Mercy for all creatures. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">108.  Say: "What has come to me by inspiration is that your Allah is One Allah:will ye therefore bow to His Will [in Islam]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">109.  But if they turn back, Say: "I have proclaimed the Message to you all alikeand in truth; but I know not whether that which ye are promised is near or far. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">110.  "It is He Who knows what is open in speech and what ye hide [in yourhearts]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">111.  "I know not but that it may be a trial for you, and a grant of [worldly]livelihood [to you] for a time." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">112.  Say: "O my Lord! judge Thou in truth!" "Our Lord Most Gracious is the OneWhose assistance should be sought against the blasphemies ye utter!" </p>
