<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 2. Baqara, or the Heifer </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  A. L. M. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fearAllah; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what Wehave provided for them; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy time, and[in their hearts] have the assurance of the Hereafter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  They are on [true] guidance, from their Lord, and it is these who willprosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn themor do not warn them; they will not believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyesis a veil; great is the penalty they [incur]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Of the people there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day;"but they do not [really] believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceivethemselves, and realise [it] not! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: Andgrievous is the penalty they [incur], because they are false [to themselves]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  When it is said to them: "Make not mischief on the earth," they say: "Why,we only Want to make peace!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Of a surety, they are the ones who make mischief, but they realise [it] not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  When it is said to them: "Believe as the others believe:" They say: "Shallwe believe as the fools believe?" Nay, of a surety they are the fools, but theydo not know. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  When they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe;" but when they arealone with their evil ones, they say: "We are really with you: We [were] onlyjesting." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in theirtrespasses; so they will wander like blind ones [To and fro]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic isprofitless, and they have lost true direction, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted allaround him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So theycould not see. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return [to the path]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Or [another similitude] is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In itare zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers intheir ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the while they are in terrorof death. But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light[Helps] them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they standstill. And if Allah willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing andseeing; for Allah hath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  O ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who camebefore you, that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sentdown rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for yoursustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know [the truth]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to Ourservant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses or helpers[If there are any] besides Allah, if your [doubts] are true. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuelis men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, thattheir portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fedwith fruits therefrom, they say: "Why, this is what we were fed with before,"for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure[and holy]; and they abide therein [for ever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well ashighest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those whoreject Faith say: "What means Allah by this similitude?" By it He causes many tostray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, exceptthose who forsake [the path],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  Those who break Allah's Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder whatAllah Has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: These cause loss[only] to themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  How can ye reject the faith in Allah?- seeing that ye were without life, andHe gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring you tolife; and again to Him will ye return. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Moreover Hisdesign comprehended the heavens, for He gave order and perfection to the sevenfirmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create a vicegerent on earth."They said: "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shedblood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy [name]?" Hesaid: "I know what ye know not." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before theangels, and said: "Tell me the names of these if ye are right." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  They said: "Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hasttaught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  He said: "O Adam! Tell them their names." When he had told them, Allah said:"Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know whatye reveal and what ye conceal?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  And behold, We said to the angels: "Bow down to Adam" and they bowed down.Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  We said: "O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of thebountiful things therein as [where and when] ye will; but approach not thistree, or ye run into harm and transgression." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Then did Satan make them slip from the [garden], and get them out of thestate [of felicity] in which they had been. We said: "Get ye down, all [yepeople], with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-placeand your means of livelihood - for a time." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord Turnedtowards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  We said: "Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to youGuidance from me, whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no fear, norshall they grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  "But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be companions ofthe Fire; they shall abide therein." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  O Children of Israel! call to mind the [special] favour which I bestowedupon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil My Covenant with you, andfear none but Me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with you,and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs for a smallprice; and fear Me, and Me alone. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye know [whatit is]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down yourheads with those who bow down [in worship]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people, and forget [To practise it]yourselves, and yet ye study the Scripture? Will ye not understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Nay, seek [Allah's] help with patient perseverance and prayer: It is indeedhard, except to those who bring a lowly spirit,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord, and thatthey are to return to Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Children of Israel! call to mind the [special] favour which I bestowed uponyou, and that I preferred you to all other [for My Message]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  Then guard yourselves against a day when one soul shall not avail anothernor shall intercession be accepted for her, nor shall compensation be taken fromher, nor shall anyone be helped [from outside]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you hardtasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live;therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh'speople within your very sight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence ye tookthe calf [for worship], and ye did grievous wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion [Between rightand wrong]: There was a chance for you to be guided aright. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  And remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Ye have indeed wrongedyourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn [in repentance] to your Maker,and slay yourselves [the wrong-doers]; that will be better for you in the sightof your Maker." Then He turned towards you [in forgiveness]: For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  And remember ye said: "O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we seeAllah manifestly," but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting even as ye lookedon. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  Then We raised you up after your death: Ye had the chance to be grateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails,saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you:" [But they rebelled];to us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  And remember We said: "Enter this town, and eat of the plenty therein as yewish; but enter the gate with humility, in posture and in words, and We shallforgive you your faults and increase [the portion of] those who do good." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them;so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that they infringed[Our command] repeatedly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: "Strike therock with thy staff." Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each groupknew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided byAllah, and do no evil nor mischief on the [face of the] earth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  And remember ye said: "O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food [always];so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -itspot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions." He said: "Will yeexchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall findwhat ye want!" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew onthemselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs ofAllah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelledand went on transgressing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  Those who believe [in the Qur'an], and those who follow the Jewish[scriptures], and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah andthe Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord;on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you [The toweringheight] of Mount [Sinai] : [Saying]: "Hold firmly to what We have given you andbring [ever] to remembrance what is therein: Perchance ye may fear Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  But ye turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy ofAllah to you, ye had surely been among the lost. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of theSabbath: We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and alesson to those who fear Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  And remember Moses said to his people: "Allah commands that ye sacrifice aheifer." They said: "Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?" He said: "Allah saveme from being an ignorant [fool]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what [heifer]it is!" He said; "He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too young,but of middling age. Now do what ye are commanded!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour."He said: "He says: A fawn-coloured heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admirationof beholders!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is:To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if Allah wills." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  He said: "He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water thefields; sound and without blemish." They said: "Now hast thou brought thetruth." Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to thecrime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  So We said: "Strike the [body] with a piece of the [heifer]." Thus Allahbringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye mayunderstand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and evenworse in hardness. For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth;others there are which when split asunder send forth water; and others whichsink for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  Can ye [o ye men of Faith] entertain the hope that they will believe inyou?- Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Allah, and perverted itknowingly after they understood it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  Behold! when they meet the men of Faith, they say: "We believe": But whenthey meet each other in private, they say: "Shall you tell them what Allah hathrevealed to you, that they may engage you in argument about it before yourLord?"- Do ye not understand [their aim]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  Know they not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but [seetherein their own] desires, and they do nothing but conjecture. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say:"This is from Allah," to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them forwhat their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  And they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days:"Say: "Have ye taken a promise from Allah, for He never breaks His promise? or isit that ye say of Allah what ye do not know?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins,- theyare companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide [For ever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of theGarden: Therein shall they abide [For ever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel [to thiseffect]: Worship none but Allah; treat with kindness your parents and kindred,and orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer;and practise regular charity. Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, andye backslide [even now]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  And remember We took your covenant [to this effect]: Shed no blood amongstyou, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye solemnlyratified, and to this ye can bear witness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banisha party of you from their homes; assist [Their enemies] against them, in guiltand rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it wasnot lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that yebelieve in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those amongyou who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgmentthey shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty. For Allah is not unmindfulof what ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of theHereafter: their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers;We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear [Signs] and strengthened him with the holyspirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what yeyourselves desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?- Some ye called impostors,and others ye slay! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  They say, "Our hearts are the wrappings [which preserve Allah's Word: weneed no more]." Nay, Allah's curse is on them for their blasphemy: Little is itthey believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is withthem,- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those withoutFaith,- when there comes to them that which they [should] have recognised, theyrefuse to believe in it but the curse of Allah is on those without Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that theydeny [the revelation] which Allah has sent down, in insolent envy that Allah ofHis Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus have they drawnon themselves Wrath upon Wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those whoreject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say,"We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even ifit be Truth confirming what is with them. Say: "Why then have ye slain theprophets of Allah in times gone by, if ye did indeed believe?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  There came to you Moses with clear [Signs]; yet ye worshipped the calf[Even] after that, and ye did behave wrongfully. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you [the toweringheight] of Mount [Sinai]: [Saying]: "Hold firmly to what We have given you, andhearken [to the Law]": They said:" We hear, and we disobey:" And they had todrink into their hearts [of the taint] of the calf because of theirFaithlessness. Say: "Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have anyfaith!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  Say: "If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially, and not for anyoneelse, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  But they will never seek for death, on account of the [sins] which theirhands have sent on before them. and Allah is well-acquainted with the wrong­doers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  Thou wilt indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life,-even morethan the idolaters: Each one of them wishes He could be given a life of a </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from [due]punishment. For Allah sees well all that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">97.  Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the [revelation] tothy heart by Allah's will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance andglad tidings for those who believe,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">98.  Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, to Gabriel andMichael,- Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">99.  We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs [ayat]; and none reject them butthose who are perverse. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">100.  Is it not [the case] that every time they make a covenant, some party amongthem throw it aside?- Nay, Most of them are faithless. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">101.  And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what waswith them, a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of Allah behindtheir backs, as if [it had been something] they did not know! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">102.  They followed what the evil ones gave out [falsely] against the power ofSolomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching menMagic, and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut.But neither of these taught anyone [Such things] without saying: "We are onlyfor trial; so do not blaspheme." They learned from them the means to sow discordbetween man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah'spermission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And theyknew that the buyers of [magic] would have no share in the happiness of theHereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if theybut knew! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">103.  If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far betterhad been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">104.  O ye of Faith! Say not [to the Messenger] words of ambiguous import, butwords of respect; and hearken [to him]: To those without Faith is a grievouspunishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">105.  It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the Book,nor of the Pagans, that anything good should come down to you from your Lord.But Allah will choose for His special Mercy whom He will - for Allah is Lord ofgrace abounding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">106.  None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but Wesubstitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah Hath powerover all things? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">107.  Knowest thou not that to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens andthe earth? And besides Him ye have neither patron nor helper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">108.  Would ye question your Messenger as Moses was questioned of old? butwhoever changeth from Faith to Unbelief, Hath strayed without doubt from theeven way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">109.  Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could Turn you [people]back to infidelity after ye have believed, from selfish envy, after the Truthhath become Manifest unto them: But forgive and overlook, Till Allah accomplishHis purpose; for Allah Hath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">110.  And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good yesend forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah: for Allahsees Well all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">111.  And they say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or aChristian." Those are their [vain] desires. Say: "Produce your proof if ye aretruthful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">112.  Nay,-whoever submits His whole self to Allah and is a doer of good,- Hewill get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall theygrieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">113.  The Jews say: "The Christians have naught [to stand] upon; and theChristians say: "The Jews have naught [To stand] upon." Yet they [Profess to]study the [same] Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; butAllah will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">114.  And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worshipof Allah, Allah's name should be celebrated?-whose zeal is [in fact] to ruinthem? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear.For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world, and in the world to come,an exceeding torment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">115.  To Allah belong the east and the West: Whithersoever ye turn, there is thepresence of Allah. For Allah is all-Pervading, all-Knowing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">116.  They say: "Allah hath begotten a son" :Glory be to Him.-Nay, to Him belongsall that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders worship to Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">117.  To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: When Hedecreeth a matter, He saith to it: "Be," and it is. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">118.  Say those without knowledge: "Why speaketh not Allah unto us? or why comethnot unto us a Sign?" So said the people before them words of similar import.Their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the Signs unto any people whohold firmly to Faith [in their hearts]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">119.  Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner:But of thee no question shall be asked of the Companions of the Blazing Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="122">120.  Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion. Say: "The Guidance of Allah,-that is the [only]Guidance." Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hathreached thee, then wouldst thou find neither Protector nor helper against Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">121.  Those to whom We have sent the Book study it as it should be studied: Theyare the ones that believe therein: Those who reject faith therein,- the loss istheir own. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">122.  O Children of Israel! call to mind the special favour which I bestowed uponyou, and that I preferred you to all others [for My Message]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="125">123.  Then guard yourselves against a-Day when one soul shall not avail another,nor shall compensation be accepted from her nor shall intercession profit hernor shall anyone be helped [from outside]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="126">124.  And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands,which he fulfilled: He said: "I will make thee an Imam to the Nations." He pleaded: "And also [Imams] from my offspring!" He answered: "But My Promise isnot within the reach of evil-doers." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="127">125.  Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place ofsafety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and Wecovenanted with Abraham and Isma'il, that they should sanctify My House forthose who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostratethemselves [therein in prayer]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="128">126.  And remember Abraham said: "My Lord, make this a City of Peace, and feedits people with fruits,-such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day." Hesaid: "[Yea], and such as reject Faith,-for a while will I grant them theirpleasure, but will soon drive them to the torment of Fire,- an evil destination[indeed]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="129">127.  And remember Abraham and Isma'il raised the foundations of the House [Withthis prayer]: "Our Lord! Accept [this service] from us: For Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-knowing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="130">128.  "Our Lord! make of us Muslims, bowing to Thy [Will], and of our progeny apeople Muslim, bowing to Thy [will]; and show us our place for the celebrationof [due] rites; and turn unto us [in Mercy]; for Thou art the Oft-Returning,Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="131">129.  "Our Lord! send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall rehearseThy Signs to them and instruct them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them:For Thou art the Exalted in Might, the Wise." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="132">130.  And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debase theirsouls with folly? Him We chose and rendered pure in this world: And he will bein the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="133">131.  Behold! his Lord said to him: "Bow [thy will to Me]:" He said: "I bow [mywill] to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="134">132.  And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob;"Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in theFaith of Islam." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="135">133.  Were ye witnesses when death appeared before Jacob? Behold, he said to hissons: "What will ye worship after me?" They said: "We shall worship Thy god andthe god of thy fathers, of Abraham, Isma'il and Isaac,- the one [True] Allah: ToHim we bow [in Islam]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="136">134.  That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of whatthey did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in yourcase! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="137">135.  They say: "Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided [To salvation]."Say thou: "Nay! [I would rather] the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joinednot gods with Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="138">136.  Say ye: "We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and toAbraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses andJesus, and that given to [all] prophets from their Lord: We make no differencebetween one and another of them: And we bow to Allah [in Islam]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="139">137.  So if they believe as ye believe, they are indeed on the right path; but ifthey turn back, it is they who are in schism; but Allah will suffice thee asagainst them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="140">138.  [Our religion is] the Baptism of Allah: And who can baptize better thanAllah? And it is He Whom we worship. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="141">139.  Say: Will ye dispute with us about Allah, seeing that He is our Lord andyour Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and ye for yours; and that Weare sincere [in our faith] in Him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="142">140.  Or do ye say that Abraham, Isma'il Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews orChristians? Say: Do ye know better than Allah? Ah! who is more unjust than thosewho conceal the testimony they have from Allah? but Allah is not unmindful ofwhat ye do! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="143">141.  That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of whatthey did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in yourcase: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="144">142.  The fools among the people will say: "What hath turned them from the Qiblato which they were used?" Say: To Allah belong both east and West: He guidethwhom He will to a Way that is straight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="145">143.  Thus, have We made of you an Ummat justly balanced, that ye might bewitnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves; and Weappointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed theMessenger from those who would turn on their heels [From the Faith]. Indeed itwas [A change] momentous, except to those guided by Allah. And never would AllahMake your faith of no effect. For Allah is to all people Most surely full ofkindness, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="146">144.  We see the turning of thy face [for guidance to the heavens: now Shall Weturn thee to a Qibla that shall please thee. Turn then Thy face in the directionof the sacred Mosque: Wherever ye are, turn your faces in that direction. Thepeople of the Book know well that that is the truth from their Lord. Nor isAllah unmindful of what they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="147">145.  Even if thou wert to bring to the people of the Book all the Signs[together], they would not follow Thy Qibla; nor art thou going to follow theirQibla; nor indeed will they follow each other's Qibla. If thou after theknowledge hath reached thee, Wert to follow their [vain] desires,-then wert thouIndeed [clearly] in the wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="148">146.  The people of the Book know this as they know their own sons; but some ofthem conceal the truth which they themselves know. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="149">147.  The Truth is from thy Lord; so be not at all in doubt. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="150">148.  To each is a goal to which Allah turns him; then strive together [as in arace] Towards all that is good. Wheresoever ye are, Allah will bring youTogether. For Allah Hath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="151">149.  From whencesoever Thou startest forth, turn Thy face in the direction ofthe sacred Mosque; that is indeed the truth from the Lord. And Allah is notunmindful of what ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="152">150.  So from whencesoever Thou startest forth, turn Thy face in the direction ofthe sacred Mosque; and wheresoever ye are, Turn your face thither: that there beno ground of dispute against you among the people, except those of them that arebent on wickedness; so fear them not, but fear Me; and that I may complete Myfavours on you, and ye May [consent to] be guided; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="153">151.  A similar [favour have ye already received] in that We have sent among youa Messenger of your own, rehearsing to you Our Signs, and sanctifying you, andinstructing you in Scripture and Wisdom, and in new knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="154">152.  Then do ye remember Me; I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and rejectnot Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="155">153.  O ye who believe! seek help with patient perseverance and prayer; for Allahis with those who patiently persevere. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="156">154.  And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah: "They are dead."Nay, they are living, though ye perceive [it] not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="157">155.  Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss ingoods or lives or the fruits [of your toil], but give glad tidings to those whopatiently persevere, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="158">156.  Who say, when afflicted with calamity: "To Allah We belong, and to Him isour return":-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="159">157.  They are those on whom [Descend] blessings from Allah, and Mercy, and theyare the ones that receive guidance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="160">158.  Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those whovisit the House in the Season or at other times, should compass them round, itis no sin in them. And if any one obeyeth his own impulse to good,- be sure thatAllah is He Who recogniseth and knoweth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="161">159.  Those who conceal the clear [Signs] We have sent down, and the Guidance,after We have made it clear for the people in the Book,-on them shall be Allah'scurse, and the curse of those entitled to curse,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="162">160.  Except those who repent and make amends and openly declare [the Truth]: Tothem I turn; for I am Oft-returning, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="163">161.  Those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- on them is Allah's curse, andthe curse of angels, and of all mankind; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="164">162.  They will abide therein: Their penalty will not be lightened, nor willrespite be their [lot]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="165">163.  And your Allah is One Allah: There is no god but He, Most Gracious, MostMerciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="166">164.  Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation ofthe night and the day; in the sailing of the ships through the ocean for theprofit of mankind; in the rain which Allah Sends down from the skies, and thelife which He gives therewith to an earth that is dead; in the beasts of allkinds that He scatters through the earth; in the change of the winds, and theclouds which they Trail like their slaves between the sky and the earth;- [Here]indeed are Signs for a people that are wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="167">165.  Yet there are men who take [for worship] others besides Allah, as equal[with Allah]: They love them as they should love Allah. But those of Faith areoverflowing in their love for Allah. If only the unrighteous could see, behold,they would see the penalty: that to Allah belongs all power, and Allah willstrongly enforce the penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="168">166.  Then would those who are followed clear themselves of those who follow [them] : They would see the penalty, and all relations between them would be cutoff. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="169">167.  And those who followed would say: "If only We had one more chance, We wouldclear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves of us." Thus will Allahshow them [The fruits of] their deeds as [nothing but] regrets. Nor will therebe a way for them out of the Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="170">168.  O ye people! Eat of what is on earth, Lawful and good; and do not followthe footsteps of the evil one, for he is to you an avowed enemy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="171">169.  For he commands you what is evil and shameful, and that ye should say ofAllah that of which ye have no knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="172">170.  When it is said to them: "Follow what Allah hath revealed:" They say: "Nay!we shall follow the ways of our fathers." What! even though their fathers Werevoid of wisdom and guidance? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="173">171.  The parable of those who reject Faith is as if one were to shout Like agoat-herd, to things that listen to nothing but calls and cries: Deaf, dumb, andblind, they are void of wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="174">172.  O ye who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for you, andbe grateful to Allah, if it is Him ye worship. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="175">173.  He hath only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine,and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that of Allah. But ifone is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing duelimits,- then is he guiltless. For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="176">174.  Those who conceal Allah's revelations in the Book, and purchase for them amiserable profit,- they swallow into themselves naught but Fire; Allah will notaddress them on the Day of Resurrection. Nor purify them: Grievous will be theirpenalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="177">175.  They are the ones who buy Error in place of Guidance and Torment in placeof Forgiveness. Ah! what boldness [They show] for the Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="178">176.  [Their doom is] because Allah sent down the Book in truth but those whoseek causes of dispute in the Book are in a schism Far [from the purpose]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="179">177.  It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West; butit is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, andthe Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him,for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask,and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regularcharity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient,in pain [or suffering] and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Suchare the people of truth, the Allah-fearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="180">178.  O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases ofmurder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman.But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant anyreasonable demand, and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is aconcession and a Mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limitsshall be in grave penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="181">179.  In the Law of Equality there is [saving of] Life to you, o ye men ofunderstanding; that ye may restrain yourselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="182">180.  It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any goodsthat he make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonableusage; this is due from the Allah-fearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="183">181.  If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the guilt shall be on thosewho make the change. For Allah hears and knows [All things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="184">182.  But if anyone fears partiality or wrong-doing on the part of the testator,and makes peace between [The parties concerned], there is no wrong in him: ForAllah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="185">183.  O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed tothose before you, that ye may [learn] self-restraint,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="186">184.  [Fasting] for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on ajourney, the prescribed number [Should be made up] from days later. For thosewho can do it [With hardship], is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent.But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is better for him. And itis better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="187">185.  Ramadhan is the [month] in which was sent down the Qur'an, as a guide tomankind, also clear [Signs] for guidance and judgment [Between right and wrong].So every one of you who is present [at his home] during that month should spendit in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed period[Should be made up] by days later. Allah intends every facility for you; He does </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="188">not want to put to difficulties. [He wants you] to complete the prescribedperiod, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall begrateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="189">186.  When My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close [to them]: Ilisten to the prayer of every suppliant when he calleth on Me: Let them also,with a will, Listen to My call, and believe in Me: That they may walk in theright way. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="190">187.  Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives.They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth what ye used todo secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and forgave you; so nowassociate with them, and seek what Allah Hath ordained for you, and eat anddrink, until the white thread of dawn appear to you distinct from its blackthread; then complete your fast Till the night appears; but do not associatewith your wives while ye are in retreat in the mosques. Those are Limits [setby] Allah: Approach not nigh thereto. Thus doth Allah make clear His Signs tomen: that they may learn self- restraint. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="191">188.  And do not eat up your property among yourselves for vanities, nor use itas bait for the judges, with intent that ye may eat up wrongfully and knowinglya little of [other] people's property. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="192">189.  They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to markfixed periods of time in [the affairs of] men, and for Pilgrimage. It is novirtue if ye enter your houses from the back: It is virtue if ye fear Allah.Enter houses through the proper doors: And fear Allah: That ye may prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="193">190.  Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgresslimits; for Allah loveth not transgressors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="194">191.  And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where theyhave Turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter; butfight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they [first] fight you there; but ifthey fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="195">192.  But if they cease, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="196">193.  And fight them on until there is no more Tumult or oppression, and thereprevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there be no hostilityexcept to those who practise oppression. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="197">194.  The prohibited month for the prohibited month,- and so for all thingsprohibited,- there is the law of equality. If then any one transgresses theprohibition against you, Transgress ye likewise against him. But fear Allah, andknow that Allah is with those who restrain themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="198">195.  And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, and make not your ownhands contribute to [your] destruction; but do good; for Allah loveth those whodo good. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="199">196.  And complete the Hajj or 'umra in the service of Allah. But if ye areprevented [From completing it], send an offering for sacrifice, such as ye mayfind, and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place ofsacrifice. And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his scalp,[Necessitating shaving], [He should] in compensation either fast, or feed thepoor, or offer sacrifice; and when ye are in peaceful conditions [again], if anyone wishes to continue the 'umra on to the hajj, He must make an offering, suchas he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, He should fast three days duringthe hajj and seven days on his return, Making ten days in all. This is for thosewhose household is not in [the precincts of] the Sacred Mosque. And fear Allah,and know that Allah Is strict in punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="200">197.  For Hajj are the months well known. If any one undertakes that dutytherein, Let there be no obscenity, nor wickedness, nor wrangling in the Hajj.And whatever good ye do, [be sure] Allah knoweth it. And take a provision [Withyou] for the journey, but the best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me, oye that are wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="201">198.  It is no crime in you if ye seek of the bounty of your Lord [duringpilgrimage]. Then when ye pour down from [Mount] Arafat, celebrate the praisesof Allah at the Sacred Monument, and celebrate His praises as He has directedyou, even though, before this, ye went astray. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="202">199.  Then pass on at a quick pace from the place whence it is usual for themultitude so to do, and ask for Allah's forgiveness. For Allah is Oft-forgiving,Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="203">200.  So when ye have accomplished your holy rites, celebrate the praises ofAllah, as ye used to celebrate the praises of your fathers,- yea, with far moreHeart and soul. There are men who say: "Our Lord! Give us [Thy bounties] in thisworld!" but they will have no portion in the Hereafter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="204">201.  And there are men who say: "Our Lord! Give us good in this world and goodin the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="205">202.  To these will be allotted what they have earned; and Allah is quick inaccount. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="206">203.  Celebrate the praises of Allah during the Appointed Days. But if any onehastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if any one stays on,there is no blame on him, if his aim is to do right. Then fear Allah, and knowthat ye will surely be gathered unto Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="207">204.  There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life May dazzlethee, and he calls Allah to witness about what is in his heart; yet is he themost contentious of enemies. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="208">205.  When he turns his back, His aim everywhere is to spread mischief throughthe earth and destroy crops and cattle. But Allah loveth not mischief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="209">206.  When it is said to him, "Fear Allah", He is led by arrogance to [more]crime. Enough for him is Hell;-An evil bed indeed [To lie on]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="210">207.  And there is the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure ofAllah: And Allah is full of kindness to [His] devotees. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="211">208.  O ye who believe! Enter into Islam whole-heartedly; and follow not thefootsteps of the evil one; for he is to you an avowed enemy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="212">209.  If ye backslide after the clear [Signs] have come to you, then know thatAllah is Exalted in Power, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="213">210.  Will they wait until Allah comes to them in canopies of clouds, with angels[in His train] and the question is [thus] settled? but to Allah do all questionsgo back [for decision]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="214">211.  Ask the Children of Israel how many clear [Signs] We have sent them. But ifany one, after Allah's favour has come to him, substitutes [something else],Allah is strict in punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="215">212.  The life of this world is alluring to those who reject faith, and theyscoff at those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day ofResurrection; for Allah bestows His abundance without measure on whom He will. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="216">213.  Mankind was one single nation, and Allah sent Messengers with glad tidingsand warnings; and with them He sent the Book in truth, to judge between people </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="217">in matters wherein they differed; but the People of the Book, after the clearSigns came to them, did not differ among themselves, except through selfishcontumacy. Allah by His Grace Guided the believers to the Truth, concerning thatwherein they differed. For Allah guided whom He will to a path that is straight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="218">214.  Or do ye think that ye shall enter the Garden [of bliss] without such[trials] as came to those who passed away before you? they encountered sufferingand adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the Messenger and those offaith who were with him cried: "When [will come] the help of Allah?" Ah! Verily,the help of Allah is [always] near! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="219">215.  They ask thee what they should spend [In charity]. Say: Whatever ye spendthat is good, is for parents and kindred and orphans and those in want and forwayfarers. And whatever ye do that is good, -Allah knoweth it well. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="220">216.  Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible thatye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is badfor you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="221">217.  They ask thee concerning fighting in the Prohibited Month. Say: "Fightingtherein is a grave [offence]; but graver is it in the sight of Allah to preventaccess to the path of Allah, to deny Him, to prevent access to the SacredMosque, and drive out its members." Tumult and oppression are worse thanslaughter. Nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from yourfaith if they can. And if any of you Turn back from their faith and die inunbelief, their works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter; theywill be companions of the Fire and will abide therein. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="222">218.  Those who believed and those who suffered exile and fought [and strove andstruggled] in the path of Allah,- they have the hope of the Mercy of Allah: AndAllah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="223">219.  They ask thee concerning wine and gambling. Say: "In them is great sin, andsome profit, for men; but the sin is greater than the profit." They ask thee howmuch they are to spend; Say: "What is beyond your needs." Thus doth Allah Makeclear to you His Signs: In order that ye may consider-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="224">220.  [Their bearings] on this life and the Hereafter. They ask thee concerningorphans. Say: "The best thing to do is what is for their good; if ye mix theiraffairs with yours, they are your brethren; but Allah knows the man who meansmischief from the man who means good. And if Allah had wished, He could have putyou into difficulties: He is indeed Exalted in Power, Wise." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="225">221.  Do not marry unbelieving women [idolaters], until they believe: A slavewoman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman, even though she alluresyou. Nor marry [your girls] to unbelievers until they believe: A man slave whobelieves is better than an unbeliever, even though he allures you. Unbelieversdo [but] beckon you to the Fire. But Allah beckons by His Grace to the Garden[of bliss] and forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind: That they maycelebrate His praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="226">222.  They ask thee concerning women's courses. Say: They are a hurt and apollution: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach themuntil they are clean. But when they have purified themselves, ye may approachthem in any manner, time, or place ordained for you by Allah. For Allah lovesthose who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure andclean. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="227">223.  Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how yewill; but do some good act for your souls beforehand; and fear Allah. And know </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="228">that ye are to meet Him [in the Hereafter], and give [these] good tidings tothose who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="229">224.  And make not Allah's [name] an excuse in your oaths against doing good, oracting rightly, or making peace between persons; for Allah is One Who hearethand knoweth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="230">225.  Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, butfor the intention in your hearts; and He is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="231">226.  For those who take an oath for abstention from their wives, a waiting forfour months is ordained; if then they return, Allah is Oft-forgiving, MostMerciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="232">227.  But if their intention is firm for divorce, Allah heareth and knoweth allthings. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="233">228.  Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods.Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, ifthey have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the betterright to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. Andwomen shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what isequitable; but men have a degree [of advantage] over them. And Allah is Exaltedin Power, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="234">229.  A divorce is only permissible twice: after that, the parties should eitherhold Together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness. It is not lawfulfor you, [Men], to take back any of your gifts [from your wives], except whenboth parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained byAllah. If ye [judges] do indeed fear that they would be unable to keep thelimits ordained by Allah, there is no blame on either of them if she givesomething for her freedom. These are the limits ordained by Allah; so do nottransgress them if any do transgress the limits ordained by Allah, such personswrong [Themselves as well as others]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="235">230.  So if a husband divorces his wife [irrevocably], He cannot, after that, re­marry her until after she has married another husband and He has divorced her.In that case there is no blame on either of them if they re-unite, provided theyfeel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. Such are the limitsordained by Allah, which He makes plain to those who understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="236">231.  When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ['Iddat], eithertake them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable terms; but donot take them back to injure them, [or] to take undue advantage; if any one doesthat; He wrongs his own soul. Do not treat Allah's Signs as a jest, but solemnlyrehearse Allah's favours on you, and the fact that He sent down to you the Bookand Wisdom, for your instruction. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is wellacquainted with all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="237">232.  When ye divorce women, and they fulfil the term of their ['Iddat], do notprevent them from marrying their [former] husbands, if they mutually agree onequitable terms. This instruction is for all amongst you, who believe in Allahand the Last Day. That is [the course Making for] most virtue and purity amongstyou and Allah knows, and ye know not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="238">233.  The mothers shall give such to their offspring for two whole years, if thefather desires to complete the term. But he shall bear the cost of their foodand clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have a burden laid on it greaterthan it can bear. No mother shall be Treated unfairly on account of her child.Nor father on account of his child, an heir shall be chargeable in the same way.If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="239">there is no blame on them. If ye decide on a foster-mother for your offspring,there is no blame on you, provided ye pay [the mother] what ye offered, onequitable terms. But fear Allah and know that Allah sees well what ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="240">234.  If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait concerningthemselves four months and ten days: When they have fulfilled their term, thereis no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonablemanner. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="241">235.  There is no blame on you if ye make an offer of betrothal or hold it inyour hearts. Allah knows that ye cherish them in your hearts: But do not make asecret contract with them except in terms Honourable, nor resolve on the tie ofmarriage till the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that Allah Knoweth whatis in your hearts, and take heed of Him; and know that Allah is Oft-forgiving,Most Forbearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="242">236.  There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or thefixation of their dower; but bestow on them [A suitable gift], the wealthyaccording to his means, and the poor according to his means;- A gift of areasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="243">237.  And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of adower for them, then the half of the dower [Is due to them], unless they remitit or [the man's half] is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie;and the remission [of the man's half] is the nearest to righteousness. And donot forget Liberality between yourselves. For Allah sees well all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="244">238.  Guard strictly your [habit of] prayers, especially the Middle Prayer; andstand before Allah in a devout [frame of mind]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="245">239.  If ye fear [an enemy], pray on foot, or riding, [as may be mostconvenient], but when ye are in security, celebrate Allah's praises in themanner He has taught you, which ye knew not [before]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="246">240.  Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows ayear's maintenance and residence; but if they leave [The residence], there is noblame on you for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. AndAllah is Exalted in Power, Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="247">241.  For divorced women Maintenance [should be provided] on a reasonable[scale]. This is a duty on the righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="248">242.  Thus doth Allah Make clear His Signs to you: In order that ye mayunderstand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="249">243.  Didst thou not Turn by vision to those who abandoned their homes, thoughthey were thousands [In number], for fear of death? Allah said to them: "Die":Then He restored them to life. For Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but Mostof them are ungrateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="250">244.  Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knowethall things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="251">245.  Who is he that will loan to Allah a beautiful loan, which Allah will doubleunto his credit and multiply many times? It is Allah that giveth [you] Want orplenty, and to Him shall be your return. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="252">246.  Hast thou not Turned thy vision to the Chiefs of the Children of Israelafter [the time of] Moses? they said to a prophet [That was] among them:"Appoint for us a king, that we May fight in the cause of Allah." He said: "Isit not possible, if ye were commanded to fight, that that ye will not fight?"They said: "How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, seeing that wewere turned out of our homes and our families?" but when they were commanded to </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="253">fight, they turned back, except a small band among them. But Allah Has fullknowledge of those who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="254">247.  Their Prophet said to them: "Allah hath appointed Talut as king over you."They said: "How can he exercise authority over us when we are better fitted thanhe to exercise authority, and he is not even gifted, with wealth in abundance?"He said: "Allah hath Chosen him above you, and hath gifted him abundantly withknowledge and bodily prowess: Allah Granteth His authority to whom He pleaseth.Allah careth for all, and He knoweth all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="255">248.  And [further] their Prophet said to them: "A Sign of his authority is thatthere shall come to you the Ark of the covenant, with [an assurance] therein ofsecurity from your Lord, and the relics left by the family of Moses and thefamily of Aaron, carried by angels. In this is a symbol for you if ye indeedhave faith." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="256">249.  When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: "Allah will test you at thestream: if any drinks of its water, He goes not with my army: Only those whotaste not of it go with me: A mere sip out of the hand is excused." but they alldrank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river,- He and the faithfulones with him,- they said: "This day We cannot cope with Goliath and hisforces." but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said: "How oft,by Allah's will, Hath a small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with thosewho steadfastly persevere." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="257">250.  When they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces, they prayed: "Our Lord!Pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm: Help us against those thatreject faith." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="258">251.  By Allah's will they routed them; and David slew Goliath; and Allah gavehim power and wisdom and taught him whatever [else] He willed. And did not AllahCheck one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full ofmischief: But Allah is full of bounty to all the worlds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="259">252.  These are the Signs of Allah: we rehearse them to thee in truth: verilyThou art one of the messengers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="260">253.  Those messengers We endowed with gifts, some above others: To one of themAllah spoke; others He raised to degrees [of honour]; to Jesus the son of MaryWe gave clear [Signs], and strengthened him with the holy spirit. If Allah hadso willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among each other, afterclear [Signs] had come to them, but they [chose] to wrangle, some believing andothers rejecting. If Allah had so willed, they would not have fought each other;but Allah Fulfilleth His plan. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="261">254.  O ye who believe! Spend out of [the bounties] We have provided for you,before the Day comes when no bargaining [Will avail], nor friendship norintercession. Those who reject Faith they are the wrong-doers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="262">255.  Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. Noslumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth.Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth? He knowethwhat [appeareth to His creatures as] before or after or behind them. Nor shallthey compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His Throne doth extendover the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding andpreserving them for He is the Most High, the Supreme [in glory]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="263">256.  Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error:whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthyhand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="264">257.  Allah is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of darknessHe will lead them forth into light. Of those who reject faith the patrons arethe evil ones: from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness.They will be companions of the fire, to dwell therein [For ever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="265">258.  Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham About hisLord, because Allah had granted him power? Abraham said: "My Lord is He WhoGiveth life and death." He said: "I give life and death". Said Abraham: "But itis Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West." Thus was he confounded who [in arrogance] rejected faith.Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="266">259.  Or [take] the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to itsroofs. He said: "Oh! how shall Allah bring it [ever] to life, after [this] itsdeath?" but Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up[again]. He said: "How long didst thou tarry [thus]?" He said: [Perhaps] a dayor part of a day." He said: "Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; butlook at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thydonkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people, Look further at thebones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh." When this wasshown clearly to him, he said: "I know that Allah hath power over all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="267">260.  When Abraham said: "Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead," Hereplied: "Have you no faith?" He said "Yes, but just to reassure my heart."Allah said, "Take four birds, draw them to you, and cut their bodies to pieces.Scatter them over the mountain-tops, then call them back. They will come swiftlyto you. Know that Allah is Mighty, Wise." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="268">261.  The parable of those who spend their substance in the way of Allah is thatof a grain of corn: it groweth seven ears, and each ear Hath a hundred grains.Allah giveth manifold increase to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all andHe knoweth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="269">262.  Those who spend their substance in the cause of Allah, and follow not uptheir gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury,-for them theirreward is with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="270">263.  Kind words and the covering of faults are better than charity followed byinjury. Allah is free of all wants, and He is Most-Forbearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="271">264.  O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosityor by injury,- like those who spend their substance to be seen of men, butbelieve neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. They are in parable like a hard,barren rock, on which is a little soil: on it falls heavy rain, which leaves it[Just] a bare stone. They will be able to do nothing with aught they haveearned. And Allah guideth not those who reject faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="272">265.  And the likeness of those who spend their substance, seeking to pleaseAllah and to strengthen their souls, is as a garden, high and fertile: heavyrain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of harvest, and if itreceives not Heavy rain, light moisture sufficeth it. Allah seeth well whateverye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="273">266.  Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and vinesand streams flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruit, while he is strickenwith old age, and his children are not strong [enough to look after themselves]-that it should be caught in a whirlwind, with fire therein, and be burnt up?Thus doth Allah make clear to you [His] Signs; that ye may consider. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="274">267.  O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have [honourably]earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="275">not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out of it ye maygive away something, when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closedeyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants, and worthy of all praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="276">268.  The Evil one threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct unseemly.Allah promiseth you His forgiveness and bounties. And Allah careth for all andHe knoweth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="277">269.  He granteth wisdom to whom He pleaseth; and he to whom wisdom is grantedreceiveth indeed a benefit overflowing; but none will grasp the Message but menof understanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="278">270.  And whatever ye spend in charity or devotion, be sure Allah knows it all.But the wrong-doers have no helpers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="279">271.  If ye disclose [acts of] charity, even so it is well, but if ye concealthem, and make them reach those [really] in need, that is best for you: It willremove from you some of your [stains of] evil. And Allah is well acquainted withwhat ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="280">272.  It is not required of thee [O Messenger], to set them on the right path,but Allah sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. Whatever of good ye givebenefits your own souls, and ye shall only do so seeking the "Face" of Allah.Whatever good ye give, shall be rendered back to you, and ye shall not Be dealtwith unjustly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="281">273.  [Charity is] for those in need, who, in Allah's cause are restricted [fromtravel], and cannot move about in the land, seeking [For trade or work]: theignorant man thinks, because of their modesty, that they are free from want.Thou shalt know them by their [Unfailing] mark: They beg not importunately fromall the sundry. And whatever of good ye give, be assured Allah knoweth it well. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="282">274.  Those who [in charity] spend of their goods by night and by day, in secretand in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, norshall they grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="283">275.  Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil oneby his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: "Trade is likeusury," but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who afterreceiving direction from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past;their case is for Allah [to judge]; but those who repeat [The offence] arecompanions of the Fire: They will abide therein [for ever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="284">276.  Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deedsof charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="285">277.  Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and establish regularprayers and regular charity, will have their reward with their Lord: on themshall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="286">278.  O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and give up what remains of your demand forusury, if ye are indeed believers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="287">279.  If ye do it not, Take notice of war from Allah and His Messenger: But if yeturn back, ye shall have your capital sums: Deal not unjustly, and ye shall notbe dealt with unjustly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="288">280.  If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time Till it is easy for him torepay. But if ye remit it by way of charity, that is best for you if ye onlyknew. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="289">281.  And fear the Day when ye shall be brought back to Allah. Then shall everysoul be paid what it earned, and none shall be dealt with unjustly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="290">282.  O ye who believe! When ye deal with each other, in transactions involvingfuture obligations in a fixed period of time, reduce them to writing Let ascribe write down faithfully as between the parties: let not the scribe refuseto write: as Allah Has taught him, so let him write. Let him who incurs theliability dictate, but let him fear His Lord Allah, and not diminish aught ofwhat he owes. If they party liable is mentally deficient, or weak, or unableHimself to dictate, Let his guardian dictate faithfully, and get two witnesses,out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women,such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other canremind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on [Forevidence]. Disdain not to reduce to writing [your contract] for a future period,whether it be small or big: it is juster in the sight of Allah, More suitable asevidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves but if it be atransaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blameon you if ye reduce it not to writing. But take witness whenever ye make acommercial contract; and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If ye do[such harm], it would be wickedness in you. So fear Allah; For it is Good thatteaches you. And Allah is well acquainted with all things. If ye are on ajourney, and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession [may serve thepurpose]. And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let thetrustee [faithfully] discharge his trust, and let him Fear his Lord conceal notevidence; for whoever conceals it, - his heart is tainted with sin. And Allahknoweth all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="291">283.  If ye are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession[may serve the purpose]. And if one of you deposits a thing on trust withanother, Let the trustee [Faithfully] discharge His trust, and let him fear hisLord. Conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it,- His heart is tainted withsin. And Allah Knoweth all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="292">284.  To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether ye showwhat is in your minds or conceal it, Allah Calleth you to account for it. Heforgiveth whom He pleaseth, and punisheth whom He pleaseth, for Allah hath powerover all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="293">285.  The Messenger believeth in what hath been revealed to him from his Lord, asdo the men of faith. Each one [of them] believeth in Allah, His angels, Hisbooks, and His messengers. "We make no distinction [they say] between one andanother of His messengers." And they say: "We hear, and we obey: [We seek] Thyforgiveness, our Lord, and to Thee is the end of all journeys." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="294">286.  On no soul doth Allah Place a burden greater than it can bear. It getsevery good that it earns, and it suffers every ill that it earns. [Pray:] "OurLord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error; our Lord! Lay not on us aburden Like that which Thou didst lay on those before us; Our Lord! Lay not onus a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, and grantus forgiveness. Have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector; Help us against thosewho stand against faith." </p>
