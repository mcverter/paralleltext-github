<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 39. Zumar, or the Crowds </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Power, full ofWisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Verily it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee in Truth: so serve Allah,offering Him sincere devotion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Is it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for protectors other than Allah [say]: "We only serve them in order that they maybring us nearer to Allah." Truly Allah will judge between them in that whereinthey differ. But Allah guides not such as are false and ungrateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Had Allah wished to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen whom Hepleased out of those whom He doth create: but Glory be to Him! [He is above suchthings.] He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  He created the heavens and the earth in true [proportions]: He makes theNight overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night: He has subjected the sunand the moon [to His law]: Each one follows a course for a time appointed. Isnot He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and again? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  He created you [all] from a single person: then created, of like nature, hismate; and he sent down for you eight head of cattle in pairs: He makes you, inthe wombs of your mothers, in stages, one after another, in three veils ofdarkness. such is Allah, your Lord and Cherisher: to Him belongs [all] dominion.There is no god but He: then how are ye turned away [from your true Centre]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  If ye reject [Allah], Truly Allah hath no need of you; but He liketh notingratitude from His servants: if ye are grateful, He is pleased with you. Nobearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. In the end, to your Lord isyour Return, when He will tell you the truth of all that ye did [in this life].for He knoweth well all that is in [men's] hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  When some trouble toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning to Him inrepentance: but when He bestoweth a favour upon him as from Himself, [man] dothforget what he cried and prayed for before, and he doth set up rivals untoAllah, thus misleading others from Allah's Path. Say, "Enjoy thy blasphemy for alittle while: verily thou art [one] of the Companions of the Fire!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himselfor standing [in adoration], who takes heed of the Hereafter, and who places hishope in the Mercy of his Lord - [like one who does not]? Say: "Are those equal,those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Say: "O ye my servants who believe! Fear your Lord, good is [the reward] forthose who do good in this world. Spacious is Allah's earth! those who patientlypersevere will truly receive a reward without measure!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Say: "Verily, I am commanded to serve Allah with sincere devotion; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  "And I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah in Islam." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Say: "I would, if I disobeyed my Lord, indeed have fear of the Penalty of aMighty Day." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Say: "It is Allah I serve, with my sincere [and exclusive] devotion: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  "Serve ye what ye will besides him." Say: "Truly, those in loss are thosewho lose their own souls and their People on the Day of Judgment: Ah! that isindeed the [real and] evident Loss! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  They shall have Layers of Fire above them, and Layers [of Fire] below them:with this doth Allah warn off his servants: "O My Servants! then fear ye Me!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Those who eschew Evil,- and fall not into its worship,- and turn to Allah[in repentance],- for them is Good News: so announce the Good News to MyServants,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Those who listen to the Word, and follow the best [meaning] in it: those arethe ones whom Allah has guided, and those are the ones endued withunderstanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Is, then, one against whom the decree of Punishment is justly due [equal toone who eschews Evil]? Wouldst thou, then, deliver one [who is] in the Fire? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  But it is for those who fear their Lord. That lofty mansions, one aboveanother, have been built: beneath them flow rivers [of delight]: [such is] thePromise of Allah: never doth Allah fail in [His] promise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and leads it throughsprings in the earth? Then He causes to grow, therewith, produce of variouscolours: then it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then He makes it dry upand crumble away. Truly, in this, is a Message of remembrance to men ofunderstanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Is one whose heart Allah has opened to Islam, so that he has receivedEnlightenment from Allah, [no better than one hard-hearted]? Woe to those whosehearts are hardened against celebrating the praises of Allah! they aremanifestly wandering [in error]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Allah has revealed [from time to time] the most beautiful Message in theform of a Book, consistent with itself, [yet] repeating [its teaching in variousaspects]: the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat; then theirskins and their hearts do soften to the celebration of Allah's praises. Such isthe guidance of Allah: He guides therewith whom He pleases, but such as Allahleaves to stray, can have none to guide. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Is, then, one who has to fear the brunt of the Penalty on the Day ofJudgment [and receive it] on his face, [like one guarded therefrom]? It will besaid to the wrong-doers: "Taste ye [the fruits of] what ye earned!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Those before them [also] rejected [revelation], and so the Punishment cameto them from directions they did not perceive. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  So Allah gave them a taste of humiliation in the present life, but greateris the punishment of the Hereafter, if they only knew! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  We have put forth for men, in this Qur'an every kind of Parable, in orderthat they may receive admonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  [It is] a Qur'an in Arabic, without any crookedness [therein]: in order thatthey may guard against Evil. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Allah puts forth a Parable a man belonging to many partners at variance witheach other, and a man belonging entirely to one master: are those two equal incomparison? Praise be to Allah! but most of them have no knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Truly thou wilt die [one day], and truly they [too] will die [one day]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  In the end will ye [all], on the Day of Judgment, settle your disputes inthe presence of your Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Who, then, doth more wrong than one who utters a lie concerning Allah, andrejects the Truth when it comes to him; is there not in Hell an abode forblasphemers? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  And he who brings the Truth and he who confirms [and supports] it - such arethe men who do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  They shall have all that they wish for, in the presence of their Lord: suchis the reward of those who do good: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  So that Allah will turn off from them [even] the worst in their deeds andgive them their reward according to the best of what they have done. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Is not Allah enough for his Servant? But they try to frighten thee withother [gods] besides Him! for such as Allah leaves to stray, there can be noguide. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  And such as Allah doth guide there can be none to lead astray. Is not AllahExalted in Power, [Able to enforce His Will], Lord of Retribution? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth,they would be sure to say, "Allah". Say: "See ye then? the things that ye invokebesides Allah,- can they, if Allah wills some Penalty for me, remove HisPenalty?- Or if He wills some Grace for me, can they keep back his Grace?" Say:"Sufficient is Allah for me! In Him trust those who put their trust." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  Say: "O my People! Do whatever ye can: I will do [my part]: but soon will yeknow-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  "Who it is to whom comes a Penalty of ignominy, and on whom descends aPenalty that abides." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  Verily We have revealed the Book to thee in Truth, for [instructing]mankind. He, then, that receives guidance benefits his own soul: but he thatstrays injures his own soul. Nor art thou set over them to dispose of theiraffairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  It is Allah that takes the souls [of men] at death; and those that die not[He takes] during their sleep: those on whom He has passed the decree of death,He keeps back [from returning to life], but the rest He sends [to their bodies]for a term appointed verily in this are Signs for those who reflect. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  What! Do they take for intercessors others besides Allah? Say: "Even if theyhave no power whatever and no intelligence?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Say: "To Allah belongs exclusively [the right to grant] intercession: to Himbelongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: In the End, it is to Him thatye shall be brought back." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  When Allah, the One and Only, is mentioned, the hearts of those who believenot in the Hereafter are filled with disgust and horror; but when [gods] otherthan He are mentioned, behold, they are filled with joy! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  Say: "O Allah! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of all that ishidden and open! it is Thou that wilt judge between Thy Servants in thosematters about which they have differed." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Even if the wrong-doers had all that there is on earth, and as much more,[in vain] would they offer it for ransom from the pain of the Penalty on the Dayof Judgment: but something will confront them from Allah, which they could neverhave counted upon! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  For the evils of their Deeds will confront them, and they will be[completely] encircled by that which they used to mock at! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Now, when trouble touches man, he cries to Us: But when We bestow a favourupon him as from Ourselves, he says, "This has been given to me because of acertain knowledge [I have]!" Nay, but this is but a trial, but most of themunderstand not! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  Thus did the [generations] before them say! But all that they did was of noprofit to them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  Nay, the evil results of their Deeds overtook them. And the wrong-doers ofthis [generation]- the evil results of their Deeds will soon overtake them[too], and they will never be able to frustrate [Our Plan]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  Know they not that Allah enlarges the provision or restricts it, for any Hepleases? Verily, in this are Signs for those who believe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  Say: "O my Servants who have transgressed against their souls! Despair notof the Mercy of Allah: for Allah forgives all sins: for He is Oft- Forgiving,Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  "Turn ye to our Lord [in repentance] and bow to His [Will], before thePenalty comes on you: after that ye shall not be helped. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  "And follow the best of [the courses] revealed to you from your Lord, beforethe Penalty comes on you - of a sudden while ye perceive not!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  "Lest the soul should [then] say: 'Ah! Woe is me!- In that I neglected [myduty] towards Allah, and was but among those who mocked!'-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  "Or [lest] it should say: 'If only Allah had guided me, I should certainlyhave been among the righteous!'-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  "Or [lest] it should say when it [actually] sees the penalty: 'If only I hadanother chance, I should certainly be among those who do good!' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  "[The reply will be:] 'Nay, but there came to thee my Signs, and thou didstreject them: thou wast Haughty, and became one of those who reject faith!'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  On the Day of Judgment wilt thou see those who told lies against Allah;-their faces will be turned black; Is there not in Hell an abode for the Haughty? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  But Allah will deliver the righteous to their place of salvation: no evilshall touch them, nor shall they grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian and Disposer ofall affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: and those who rejectthe Signs of Allah,- it is they who will be in loss. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  Say: "Is it some one other than Allah that ye order me to worship, O yeignorant ones?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  But it has already been revealed to thee,- as it was to those before thee,-"If thou wert to join [gods with Allah], truly fruitless will be thy work [inlife], and thou wilt surely be in the ranks of those who lose [all spiritualgood]". </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  Nay, but worship Allah, and be of those who give thanks. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  No just estimate have they made of Allah, such as is due to Him: On the Dayof Judgment the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the heavens willbe rolled up in His right hand: Glory to Him! High is He above the Partners theyattribute to Him! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  The Trumpet will [just] be sounded, when all that are in the heavens and onearth will swoon, except such as it will please Allah [to exempt]. Then will asecond one be sounded, when, behold, they will be standing and looking on! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  And the Earth will shine with the Glory of its Lord: the Record [of Deeds]will be placed [open]; the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forwardand a just decision pronounced between them; and they will not be wronged [inthe least]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  And to every soul will be paid in full [the fruit] of its Deeds; and [Allah]knoweth best all that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  The Unbelievers will be led to Hell in crowd: until, when they arrive,there, its gates will be opened. And its keepers will say, "Did not messengerscome to you from among yourselves, rehearsing to you the Signs of your Lord, andwarning you of the Meeting of This Day of yours?" The answer will be: "True: butthe Decree of Punishment has been proved true against the Unbelievers!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  [To them] will be said: "Enter ye the gates of Hell, to dwell therein: andevil is [this] Abode of the Arrogant!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  And those who feared their Lord will be led to the Garden in crowds: until behold, they arrive there; its gates will be opened; and its keepers will say:"Peace be upon you! well have ye done! enter ye here, to dwell therein." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  They will say: "Praise be to Allah, Who has truly fulfilled His Promise tous, and has given us [this] land in heritage: We can dwell in the Garden as wewill: how excellent a reward for those who work [righteousness]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  And thou wilt see the angels surrounding the Throne [Divine] on all sides,singing Glory and Praise to their Lord. The Decision between them [at Judgment]will be in [perfect] justice, and the cry [on all sides] will be, "Praise be toAllah, the Lord of the Worlds!" </p>
