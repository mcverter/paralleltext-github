<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 75. Qiyamat, or the Resurrection </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  I do call to witness the Resurrection Day; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  And I do call to witness the self-reproaching spirit: [Eschew Evil]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Nay, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of hisfingers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  But man wishes to do wrong [even] in the time in front of him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  He questions: "When is the Day of Resurrection?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  At length, when the sight is dazed, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  And the moon is buried in darkness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And the sun and moon are joined together,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  That Day will Man say: "Where is the refuge?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  By no means! No place of safety! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Before thy Lord [alone], that Day will be the place of rest. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  That Day will Man be told [all] that he put forward, and all that he putback. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Nay, man will be evidence against himself, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Even though he were to put up his excuses. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Move not thy tongue concerning the [Qur'an] to make haste therewith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  It is for Us to collect it and to promulgate it: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  But when We have promulgated it, follow thou its recital [as promulgated]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Nay more, it is for Us to explain it [and make it clear]: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Nay, [ye men!] but ye love the fleeting life, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And leave alone the Hereafter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Some faces, that Day, will beam [in brightness and beauty];-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Looking towards their Lord; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  And some faces, that Day, will be sad and dismal, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  In the thought that some back-breaking calamity was about to be inflicted onthem; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Yea, when [the soul] reaches to the collar-bone [in its exit], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And there will be a cry, "Who is a magician [to restore him]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  And he will conclude that it was [the Time] of Parting; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  And one leg will be joined with another: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  That Day the Drive will be [all] to thy Lord! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  So he gave nothing in charity, nor did he pray!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  But on the contrary, he rejected Truth and turned away! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Then did he stalk to his family in full conceit! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Woe to thee, [O men!], yea, woe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Again, Woe to thee, [O men!], yea, woe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Does man think that he will be left uncontrolled, [without purpose]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Was he not a drop of sperm emitted [in lowly form]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  Then did he become a leech-like clot; then did [Allah] make and fashion[him] in due proportion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  And of him He made two sexes, male and female. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Has not He, [the same], the power to give life to the dead? </p>
