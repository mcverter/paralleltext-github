<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 24. Nur, or Light </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  A Sura which We have sent down and which We have ordained in it have We sent down Clear Signs, in order that ye may receive admonition. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of themwith a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matterprescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party ofthe Believers witness their punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry and but a woman similarlyguilty, or an Unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry sucha woman: to the Believers such a thing is forbidden. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And those who launch a charge against chaste women, and produce not fourwitnesses [to support their allegations],- flog them with eighty stripes; andreject their evidence ever after: for such men are wicked transgressors;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Unless they repent thereafter and mend [their conduct]; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have [insupport] no evidence but their own,- their solitary evidence [can be received]if they bear witness four times [with an oath] by Allah that they are solemnlytelling the truth; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  And the fifth [oath] [should be] that they solemnly invoke the curse of Allahon themselves if they tell a lie. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness fourtimes [with an oath] By Allah, that [her husband] is telling a lie; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And the fifth [oath] should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allahon herself if [her accuser] is telling the truth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  If it were not for Allah's grace and mercy on you, and that Allah is Oft-Returning, full of Wisdom,- [Ye would be ruined indeed]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Those who brought forward the lie are a body among yourselves: think it notto be an evil to you; On the contrary it is good for you: to every man amongthem [will come the punishment] of the sin that he earned, and to him who tookon himself the lead among them, will be a penalty grievous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Why did not the believers - men and women - when ye heard of the affair,-put the best construction on it in their own minds and say, "This [charge] is anobvious lie"? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Why did they not bring four witnesses to prove it? When they have notbrought the witnesses, such men, in the sight of Allah, [stand forth] themselvesas liars! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you, in this world and theHereafter, a grievous penalty would have seized you in that ye rushed gliblyinto this affair. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Behold, ye received it on your tongues, and said out of your mouths thingsof which ye had no knowledge; and ye thought it to be a light matter, while itwas most serious in the sight of Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  And why did ye not, when ye heard it, say? - "It is not right of us to speakof this: Glory to Allah! this is a most serious slander!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Allah doth admonish you, that ye may never repeat such [conduct], if ye are[true] Believers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  And Allah makes the Signs plain to you: for Allah is full of knowledge andwisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Those who love [to see] scandal published broadcast among the Believers,will have a grievous Penalty in this life and in the Hereafter: Allah knows, andye know not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Were it not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you, and that Allah is fullof kindness and mercy, [ye would be ruined indeed]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  O ye who believe! follow not Satan's footsteps: if any will follow thefootsteps of Satan, he will [but] command what is shameful and wrong: and wereit not for the grace and mercy of Allah on you, not one of you would ever havebeen pure: but Allah doth purify whom He pleases: and Allah is One Who hears andknows [all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Let not those among you who are endued with grace and amplitude of meansresolve by oath against helping their kinsmen, those in want, and those who haveleft their homes in Allah's cause: let them forgive and overlook, do you notwish that Allah should forgive you? For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Those who slander chaste women, indiscreet but believing, are cursed in thislife and in the Hereafter: for them is a grievous Penalty,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witnessagainst them as to their actions. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  On that Day Allah will pay them back [all] their just dues, and they willrealise that Allah is the [very] Truth, that makes all things manifest. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Women impure are for men impure, and men impure for women impure and womenof purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity:these are not affected by what people say: for them there is forgiveness, and aprovision honourable. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  O ye who believe! enter not houses other than your own, until ye have askedpermission and saluted those in them: that is best for you, in order that ye mayheed [what is seemly]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  If ye find no one in the house, enter not until permission is given to you:if ye are asked to go back, go back: that makes for greater purity foryourselves: and Allah knows well all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  It is no fault on your part to enter houses not used for living in, whichserve some [other] use for you: And Allah has knowledge of what ye reveal andwhat ye conceal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard theirmodesty: that will make for greater purity for them: And Allah is wellacquainted with all that they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guardtheir modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments exceptwhat [must ordinarily] appear thereof; that they should draw their veils overtheir bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, theirfathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, theirbrothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or theslaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they shouldnot strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah, that ye may attain Bliss. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">32.  Marry those among you who are single, or the virtuous ones among yourselves,male or female: if they are in poverty, Allah will give them means out of Hisgrace: for Allah encompasseth all, and he knoweth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">33.  Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste,until Allah gives them means out of His grace. And if any of your slaves ask fora deed in writing [to enable them to earn their freedom for a certain sum], givethem such a deed if ye know any good in them: yea, give them somethingyourselves out of the means which Allah has given to you. But force not yourmaids to prostitution when they desire chastity, in order that ye may make again in the goods of this life. But if anyone compels them, yet, after suchcompulsion, is Allah, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful [to them], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">34.  We have already sent down to you verses making things clear, an illustrationfrom [the story of] people who passed away before you, and an admonition forthose who fear [Allah]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">35.  Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The Parable of His Light isas if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp: the Lamp enclosed in Glass: theglass as it were a brilliant star: Lit from a blessed Tree, an Olive, neither ofthe east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarcetouched it: Light upon Light! Allah doth guide whom He will to His Light: Allahdoth set forth Parables for men: and Allah doth know all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">36.  [Lit is such a Light] in houses, which Allah hath permitted to be raised tohonour; for the celebration, in them, of His name: In them is He glorified inthe mornings and in the evenings, [again and again],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">37.  By men whom neither traffic nor merchandise can divert from the Remembranceof Allah, nor from regular Prayer, nor from the practice of regular Charity:Their [only] fear is for the Day when hearts and eyes will be transformed [in aworld wholly new],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">38.  That Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and addeven more for them out of His Grace: for Allah doth provide for those whom Hewill, without measure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">39.  But the Unbelievers,- their deeds are like a mirage in sandy deserts, whichthe man parched with thirst mistakes for water; until when he comes up to it, hefinds it to be nothing: But he finds Allah [ever] with him, and Allah will payhim his account: and Allah is swift in taking account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">40.  Or [the Unbelievers' state] is like the depths of darkness in a vast deepocean, overwhelmed with billow topped by billow, topped by [dark] clouds: depthsof darkness, one above another: if a man stretches out his hands, he can hardlysee it! for any to whom Allah giveth not light, there is no light! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">41.  Seest thou not that it is Allah Whose praises all beings in the heavens andon earth do celebrate, and the birds [of the air] with wings outspread? Each oneknows its own [mode of] prayer and praise. And Allah knows well all that theydo. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">42.  Yea, to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and toAllah is the final goal [of all]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">43.  Seest thou not that Allah makes the clouds move gently, then joins themtogether, then makes them into a heap? - then wilt thou see rain issue forthfrom their midst. And He sends down from the sky mountain masses [of clouds] </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">wherein is hail: He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns it away fromwhom He pleases, the vivid flash of His lightning well-nigh blinds the sight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">44.  It is Allah Who alternates the Night and the Day: verily in these things isan instructive example for those who have vision! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">45.  And Allah has created every animal from water: of them there are some thatcreep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four.Allah creates what He wills for verily Allah has power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">46.  We have indeed sent down signs that make things manifest: and Allah guideswhom He wills to a way that is straight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">47.  They say, "We believe in Allah and in the messenger, and we obey": but evenafter that, some of them turn away: they are not [really] Believers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">48.  When they are summoned to Allah and His messenger, in order that He mayjudge between them, behold some of them decline [to come]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">49.  But if the right is on their side, they come to him with all submission. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">50.  Is it that there is a disease in their hearts? or do they doubt, or are theyin fear, that Allah and His Messenger will deal unjustly with them? Nay, it isthey themselves who do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">51.  The answer of the Believers, when summoned to Allah and His Messenger, inorder that He may judge between them, is no other than this: they say, "We hearand we obey": it is such as these that will attain felicity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">52.  It is such as obey Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah and do right,that will win [in the end], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">53.  They swear their strongest oaths by Allah that, if only thou wouldst commandthem, they would leave [their homes]. Say: "Swear ye not; Obedience is [more]reasonable; verily, Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">54.  Say: "Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger: but if ye turn away, he is onlyresponsible for the duty placed on him and ye for that placed on you. If ye obeyhim, ye shall be on right guidance. The Messenger's duty is only to preach theclear [Message]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">55.  Allah has promised, to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds,that He will, of a surety, grant them in the land, inheritance [of power], as Hegranted it to those before them; that He will establish in authority theirreligion - the one which He has chosen for them; and that He will change [theirstate], after the fear in which they [lived], to one of security and peace:'They will worship Me [alone] and not associate aught with Me. 'If any do rejectFaith after this, they are rebellious and wicked. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">56.  So establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and obey theMessenger; that ye may receive mercy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">57.  Never think thou that the Unbelievers are going to frustrate [Allah's Plan]on earth: their abode is the Fire,- and it is indeed an evil refuge! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">58.  O ye who believe! let those whom your right hands possess, and the[children] among you who have not come of age ask your permission [before theycome to your presence], on three occasions: before morning prayer; the while yedoff your clothes for the noonday heat; and after the late-night prayer: theseare your three times of undress: outside those times it is not wrong for you orfor them to move about attending to each other: Thus does Allah make clear theSigns to you: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">59.  But when the children among you come of age, let them [also] ask forpermission, as do those senior to them [in age]: Thus does Allah make clear HisSigns to you: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">60.  Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage,- there is no blameon them if they lay aside their [outer] garments, provided they make not awanton display of their beauty: but it is best for them to be modest: and Allahis One Who sees and knows all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">61.  It is no fault in the blind nor in one born lame, nor in one afflicted withillness, nor in yourselves, that ye should eat in your own houses, or those ofyour fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or yourfather's brothers or your father's sisters, or your mother's brothers, or yourmother's sisters, or in houses of which the keys are in your possession, or inthe house of a sincere friend of yours: there is no blame on you, whether ye eatin company or separately. But if ye enter houses, salute each other - a greetingof blessing and purity as from Allah. Thus does Allah make clear the signs toyou: that ye may understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">62.  Only those are believers, who believe in Allah and His Messenger: when theyare with him on a matter requiring collective action, they do not depart untilthey have asked for his leave; those who ask for thy leave are those who believein Allah and His Messenger; so when they ask for thy leave, for some business oftheirs, give leave to those of them whom thou wilt, and ask Allah for theirforgiveness: for Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">63.  Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons ofone of you to another: Allah doth know those of you who slip away under shelterof some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lestsome trial befall them, or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">64.  Be quite sure that to Allah doth belong whatever is in the heavens and onearth. Well doth He know what ye are intent upon: and one day they will bebrought back to Him, and He will tell them the truth of what they did: for Allahdoth know all things. </p>
