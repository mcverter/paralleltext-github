<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 3. Al-i-Imran, or The Family of Imran </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Alif, Lam, Mim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  It is He Who sent down to thee [step by step], in truth, the Book, confirmingwhat went before it; and He sent down the Law [of Moses] and the Gospel [ofJesus] before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion [ofjudgment between right and wrong]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Then those who reject Faith in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severestpenalty, and Allah is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  From Allah, verily nothing is hidden on earth or in the heavens. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He,the Exalted in Might, the Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental [of established meaning]; they are the foundation of the Book:others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the partthereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hiddenmeanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. And those who arefirmly grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in the Book; the whole of it isfrom our Lord:" and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  "Our Lord!" [they say], "Let not our hearts deviate now after Thou hastguided us, but grant us mercy from Thine own Presence; for Thou art the Grantorof bounties without measure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  "Our Lord! Thou art He that will gather mankind Together against a day aboutwhich there is no doubt; for Allah never fails in His promise." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their [numerous]progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They are themselves but fuel forthe Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  [Their plight will be] no better than that of the people of Pharaoh, andtheir predecessors: They denied our Signs, and Allah called them to account fortheir sins. For Allah is strict in punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Say to those who reject Faith: "Soon will ye be vanquished and gatheredtogether to Hell,-an evil bed indeed [to lie on]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  "There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met [incombat]: One was fighting in the cause of Allah, the other resisting Allah;these saw with their own eyes Twice their number. But Allah doth support withHis aid whom He pleaseth. In this is a warning for such as have eyes to see." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Fair in the eyes of men is the love of things they covet: Women and sons;Heaped-up hoards of gold and silver; horses branded [for blood and excellence];and [wealth of] cattle and well-tilled land. Such are the possessions of thisworld's life; but in nearness to Allah is the best of the goals [To return to]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Say: Shall I give you glad tidings of things Far better than those? For therighteous are Gardens in nearness to their Lord, with rivers flowing beneath;therein is their eternal home; with companions pure [and holy]; and the goodpleasure of Allah. For in Allah's sight are [all] His servants,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  [Namely], those who say: "Our Lord! we have indeed believed: forgive us,then, our sins, and save us from the agony of the Fire;"-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Those who show patience, Firmness and self-control; who are true [in wordand deed]; who worship devoutly; who spend [in the way of Allah]; and who prayfor forgiveness in the early hours of the morning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  There is no god but He: That is the witness of Allah, His angels, and thoseendued with knowledge, standing firm on justice. There is no god but He, theExalted in Power, the Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  The Religion before Allah is Islam [submission to His Will]: Nor did thePeople of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, afterknowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swiftin calling to account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  So if they dispute with thee, say: "I have submitted My whole self to Allahand so have those who follow me." And say to the People of the Book and to thosewho are unlearned: "Do ye [also] submit yourselves?" If they do, they are inright guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and inAllah's sight are [all] His servants. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  As to those who deny the Signs of Allah and in defiance of right, slay theprophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them agrievous penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  They are those whose works will bear no fruit in this world and in theHereafter nor will they have anyone to help. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who have been given a portion ofthe Book? They are invited to the Book of Allah, to settle their dispute, but aparty of them Turn back and decline [The arbitration]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  This because they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbereddays": For their forgeries deceive them as to their own religion. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  But how [will they fare] when we gather them together against a day aboutwhich there is no doubt, and each soul will be paid out just what it has earned,without [favour or] injustice? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Say: "O Allah! Lord of Power [And Rule], Thou givest power to whom Thoupleasest, and Thou strippest off power from whom Thou pleasest: Thou enduestwith honour whom Thou pleasest, and Thou bringest low whom Thou pleasest: In Thyhand is all good. Verily, over all things Thou hast power. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  "Thou causest the night to gain on the day, and thou causest the day to gainon the night; Thou bringest the Living out of the dead, and Thou bringest thedead out of the Living; and Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou pleasest,without measure." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers rather thanbelievers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah: except byway of precaution, that ye may Guard yourselves from them. But Allah cautionsyou [To remember] Himself; for the final goal is to Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Say: "Whether ye hide what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah knows itall: He knows what is in the heavens, and what is on earth. And Allah has powerover all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  "On the Day when every soul will be confronted with all the good it hasdone, and all the evil it has done, it will wish there were a great distancebetween it and its evil. But Allah cautions you [To remember] Himself. And Allahis full of kindness to those that serve Him." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Say: "If ye do love Allah, Follow me: Allah will love you and forgive youyour sins: For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  Say: "Obey Allah and His Messenger": But if they turn back, Allah loveth notthose who reject Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  Allah did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of'Imran above all people,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Offspring, one of the other: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Behold! a woman of 'Imran said: "O my Lord! I do dedicate unto Thee what isin my womb for Thy special service: So accept this of me: For Thou hearest andknowest all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  When she was delivered, she said: "O my Lord! Behold! I am delivered of afemale child!"- and Allah knew best what she brought forth- "And no wise is themale Like the female. I have named her Mary, and I commend her and her offspringto Thy protection from the Evil One, the Rejected." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Right graciously did her Lord accept her: He made her grow in purity andbeauty: To the care of Zakariya was she assigned. Every time that he entered[Her] chamber to see her, He found her supplied with sustenance. He said: "OMary! Whence [comes] this to you?" She said: "From Allah: for Allah Providessustenance to whom He pleases without measure." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  There did Zakariya pray to his Lord, saying: "O my Lord! Grant unto me fromThee a progeny that is pure: for Thou art He that heareth prayer! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  While he was standing in prayer in the chamber, the angels called unto him:"Allah doth give thee glad tidings of Yahya, witnessing the truth of a Word fromAllah, and [be besides] noble, chaste, and a prophet,- of the [goodly] companyof the righteous." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have son, seeing I am very old, and my wifeis barren?" "Thus," was the answer, "Doth Allah accomplish what He willeth." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  He said: "O my Lord! Give me a Sign!" "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall bethat thou shalt speak to no man for three days but with signals. Then celebratethe praises of thy Lord again and again, and glorify Him in the evening and inthe morning." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee-chosen thee above the women of all nations. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  "O Mary! worship Thy Lord devoutly: Prostrate thyself, and bow down [inprayer] with those who bow down." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  This is part of the tidings of the things unseen, which We reveal unto thee[O Messenger!] by inspiration: Thou wast not with them when they cast lots witharrows, as to which of them should be charged with the care of Mary: Nor wastthou with them when they disputed [the point]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a Wordfrom Him: his name will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, held in honour in thisworld and the Hereafter and of [the company of] those nearest to Allah; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  "He shall speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. And he shall be[of the company] of the righteous." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  She said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man hath touched me?"He said: "Even so: Allah createth what He willeth: When He hath decreed a plan,He but saith to it, 'Be,' and it is! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  "And Allah will teach him the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  "And [appoint him] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [with thismessage]: "'I have come to you, with a Sign from your Lord, in that I make foryou out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it, and itbecomes a bird by Allah's leave: And I heal those born blind, and the lepers,and I quicken the dead, by Allah's leave; and I declare to you what ye eat, andwhat ye store in your houses. Surely therein is a Sign for you if ye didbelieve; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  "'[I have come to you], to attest the Law which was before me. And to makelawful to you part of what was [Before] forbidden to you; I have come to youwith a Sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  "'It is Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a Waythat is straight.'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  When Jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: "Who will be My helpers to[the work of] Allah?" Said the disciples: "We are Allah's helpers: We believe inAllah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  "Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow theMessenger; then write us down among those who bear witness." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  And [the unbelievers] plotted and planned, and Allah too planned, and thebest of planners is Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  Behold! Allah said: "O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself andclear thee [of the falsehoods] of those who blaspheme; I will make those whofollow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Thenshall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters whereinye dispute. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  "As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony inthis world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  "As to those who believe and work righteousness, Allah will pay them [infull] their reward; but Allah loveth not those who do wrong." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  "This is what we rehearse unto thee of the Signs and the Message of Wisdom." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him fromdust, then said to him: "Be". And he was. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  The Truth [comes] from Allah alone; so be not of those who doubt. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  If any one disputes in this matter with thee, now after [full] knowledgeHath come to thee, say: "Come! let us gather together,- our sons and your sons,our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: Then let us earnestly pray,and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He isindeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  Say: "O People of the Book! come to common terms as between us and you: Thatwe worship none but Allah; that we associate no partners with him; that we erectnot, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah." If then theyturn back, say ye: "Bear witness that we [at least] are Muslims [bowing toAllah's Will]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and theGospel Were not revealed Till after him? Have ye no understanding? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing [Even] in matters of which ye hadsome knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? Itis Allah Who knows, and ye who know not! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, andbowed his will to Allah's [Which is Islam], and he joined not gods with Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  Without doubt, among men, the nearest of kin to Abraham, are those whofollow him, as are also this Prophet and those who believe: And Allah is theProtector of those who have faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  It is the wish of a section of the People of the Book to lead you astray.But they shall lead astray [Not you], but themselves, and they do not perceive! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  Ye People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah, of which ye are[Yourselves] witnesses? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  Ye People of the Book! Why do ye clothe Truth with falsehood, and concealthe Truth, while ye have knowledge? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  A section of the People of the Book say: "Believe in the morning what isrevealed to the believers, but reject it at the end of the day; perchance theymay [themselves] Turn back; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  "And believe no one unless he follows your religion." Say: "True guidance isthe Guidance of Allah: [Fear ye] Lest a revelation be sent to someone [else]Like unto that which was sent unto you? or that those [Receiving suchrevelation] should engage you in argument before your Lord?" Say: "All bountiesare in the hand of Allah: He granteth them to whom He pleaseth: And Allah carethfor all, and He knoweth all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  For His Mercy He specially chooseth whom He pleaseth; for Allah is the Lordof bounties unbounded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  Among the People of the Book are some who, if entrusted with a hoard ofgold, will [readily] pay it back; others, who, if entrusted with a single silvercoin, will not repay it unless thou constantly stoodest demanding, because, theysay, "there is no call on us [to keep faith] with these ignorant [Pagans]." butthey tell a lie against Allah, and [well] they know it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  Nay.- Those that keep their plighted faith and act aright,-verily Allahloves those who act aright. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  As for those who sell the faith they owe to Allah and their own plightedword for a small price, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter: Nor willAllah [Deign to] speak to them or look at them on the Day of Judgment, nor willHe cleans them [of sin]: They shall have a grievous penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  There is among them a section who distort the Book with their tongues: [Asthey read] you would think it is a part of the Book, but it is no part of theBook; and they say, "That is from Allah," but it is not from Allah: It is theywho tell a lie against Allah, and [well] they know it! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  It is not [possible] that a man, to whom is given the Book, and Wisdom, andthe prophetic office, should say to people: "Be ye my worshippers rather thanAllah's": on the contrary [He would say] "Be ye worshippers of Him Who is trulythe Cherisher of all: For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied itearnestly." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  Nor would he instruct you to take angels and prophets for Lords and patrons.What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will [To Allah inIslam]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets, saying: "I give you a Bookand Wisdom; then comes to you a messenger, confirming what is with you; do yebelieve in him and render him help." Allah said: "Do ye agree, and take this myCovenant as binding on you?" They said: "We agree." He said: "Then bear witness,and I am with you among the witnesses." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  If any turn back after this, they are perverted transgressors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah?-while all creatures inthe heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will [AcceptedIslam], and to Him shall they all be brought back. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  Say: "We believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to us and what wasrevealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in [the Books] </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinctionbetween one and another among them, and to Allah do we bow our will [in Islam]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">85.  If anyone desires a religion other than Islam [submission to Allah], neverwill it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks ofthose who have lost [All spiritual good]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">86.  How shall Allah Guide those who reject Faith after they accepted it and borewitness that the Messenger was true and that Clear Signs had come unto them? butAllah guides not a people unjust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">87.  Of such the reward is that on them [rests] the curse of Allah, of Hisangels, and of all mankind;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">88.  In that will they dwell; nor will their penalty be lightened, nor respite be[their lot];-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">89.  Except for those that repent [Even] after that, and make amends; for verilyAllah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">90.  But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding totheir defiance of Faith,- never will their repentance be accepted; for they arethose who have [of set purpose] gone astray. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">91.  As to those who reject Faith, and die rejecting,- never would be acceptedfrom any such as much gold as the earth contains, though they should offer itfor ransom. For such is [in store] a penalty grievous, and they will find nohelpers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">92.  By no means shall ye attain righteousness unless ye give [freely] of thatwhich ye love; and whatever ye give, of a truth Allah knoweth it well. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">93.  All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel Madeunlawful for itself, before the Law [of Moses] was revealed. Say: "Bring ye theLaw and study it, if ye be men of truth." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">94.  If any, after this, invent a lie and attribute it to Allah, they are indeedunjust wrong-doers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">95.  Say: "Allah speaketh the Truth: follow the religion of Abraham, the sane infaith; he was not of the Pagans." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">96.  The first House [of worship] appointed for men was that at Bakka: Full ofblessing and of guidance for all kinds of beings: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">97.  In it are Signs Manifest; [for example], the Station of Abraham; whoeverenters it attains security; Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah,-those who can afford the journey; but if any deny faith, Allah stands not inneed of any of His creatures. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">98.  Say: "O People of the Book! Why reject ye the Signs of Allah, when Allah isHimself witness to all ye do?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="101">99.  Say: "O ye People of the Book! Why obstruct ye those who believe, from thepath of Allah, Seeking to make it crooked, while ye were yourselves witnesses[to Allah's Covenant]? but Allah is not unmindful of all that ye do." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="102">100.  O ye who believe! If ye listen to a faction among the People of the Book,they would [indeed] render you apostates after ye have believed! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="103">101.  And how would ye deny Faith while unto you are rehearsed the Signs ofAllah, and among you Lives the Messenger? Whoever holds firmly to Allah will beshown a way that is straight. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="104">102.  O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except ina state of Islam. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="105">103.  And hold fast, all together, by the rope which Allah [stretches out foryou], and be not divided among yourselves; and remember with gratitude Allah'sfavour on you; for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that byHis Grace, ye became brethren; and ye were on the brink of the pit of Fire, andHe saved you from it. Thus doth Allah make His Signs clear to you: That ye maybe guided. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="106">104.  Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good,enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones toattain felicity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="107">105.  Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves and fall intodisputations after receiving Clear Signs: For them is a dreadful penalty,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="108">106.  On the Day when some faces will be [lit up with] white, and some faces willbe [in the gloom of] black: To those whose faces will be black, [will be said]:"Did ye reject Faith after accepting it? Taste then the penalty for rejectingFaith." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="109">107.  But those whose faces will be [lit with] white,- they will be in [the lightof] Allah's mercy: therein to dwell [for ever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="110">108.  These are the Signs of Allah: We rehearse them to thee in Truth: And Allahmeans no injustice to any of His creatures. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="111">109.  To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: To Him do allquestions go back [for decision]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="112">110.  Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, enjoining what is right,forbidding what is wrong, and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Bookhad faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but mostof them are perverted transgressors. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="113">111.  They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; if they come out tofight you, they will show you their backs, and no help shall they get. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="114">112.  Shame is pitched over them [Like a tent] wherever they are found, exceptwhen under a covenant [of protection] from Allah and from men; they draw onthemselves wrath from Allah, and pitched over them is [the tent of] destitution.This because they rejected the Signs of Allah, and slew the prophets in defianceof right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="115">113.  Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book are a portion thatstand [For the right]: They rehearse the Signs of Allah all night long, and theyprostrate themselves in adoration. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="116">114.  They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, andforbid what is wrong; and they hasten [in emulation] in [all] good works: Theyare in the ranks of the righteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="117">115.  Of the good that they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allahknoweth well those that do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="118">116.  Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their [numerous]progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They will be companions of theFire,-dwelling therein [for ever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="119">117.  What they spend in the life of this [material] world May be likened to awind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of menwho have wronged their own souls: it is not Allah that hath wronged them, butthey wrong themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="120">118.  O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks:They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire your ruin: Rank hatred hasalready appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse. Wehave made plain to you the Signs, if ye have wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="121">119.  Ah! ye are those who love them, but they love you not,- though ye believein the whole of the Book. When they meet you, they say, "We believe": But whenthey are alone, they bite off the very tips of their fingers at you in theirrage. Say: "Perish in you rage; Allah knoweth well all the secrets of theheart." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="122">120.  If aught that is good befalls you, it grieves them; but if some misfortuneovertakes you, they rejoice at it. But if ye are constant and do right, not theleast harm will their cunning do to you; for Allah Compasseth round about allthat they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="123">121.  Remember that morning Thou didst leave Thy household [early] to post thefaithful at their stations for battle: And Allah heareth and knoweth all things: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="124">122.  Remember two of your parties Meditated cowardice; but Allah was theirprotector, and in Allah should the faithful [Ever] put their trust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="125">123.  Allah had helped you at Badr, when ye were a contemptible little force;then fear Allah; thus May ye show your gratitude. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="126">124.  Remember thou saidst to the Faithful: "Is it not enough for you that Allahshould help you with three thousand angels [Specially] sent down? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="127">125.  "Yea, - if ye remain firm, and act aright, even if the enemy should rushhere on you in hot haste, your Lord would help you with five thousand angelsMaking a terrific onslaught. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="128">126.  Allah made it but a message of hope for you, and an assurance to yourhearts: [in any case] there is no help except from Allah. The Exalted, the Wise: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="129">127.  That He might cut off a fringe of the Unbelievers or expose them to infamy,and they should then be turned back, frustrated of their purpose. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="130">128.  Not for thee, [but for Allah], is the decision: Whether He turn in mercy tothem, or punish them; for they are indeed wrong-doers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="131">129.  To Allah belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. He forgivethwhom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth; but Allah is Oft-Forgiving,Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="132">130.  O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; but fear Allah;that ye may [really] prosper. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="133">131.  Fear the Fire, which is repaired for those who reject Faith: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="134">132.  And obey Allah and the Messenger; that ye may obtain mercy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="135">133.  Be quick in the race for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whosewidth is that [of the whole] of the heavens and of the earth, prepared for therighteous,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="136">134.  Those who spend [freely], whether in prosperity, or in adversity; whorestrain anger, and pardon [all] men;- for Allah loves those who do good;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="137">135.  And those who, having done something to be ashamed of, or wronged their ownsouls, earnestly bring Allah to mind, and ask for forgiveness for their sins,-and who can forgive sins except Allah?- and are never obstinate in persistingknowingly in [the wrong] they have done. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="138">136.  For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with riversflowing underneath,- an eternal dwelling: How excellent a recompense for thosewho work [and strive]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="139">137.  Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you: travel throughthe earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="140">138.  Here is a plain statement to men, a guidance and instruction to those whofear Allah! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="141">139.  So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: For ye must gain mastery if yeare true in Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="142">140.  If a wound hath touched you, be sure a similar wound hath touched theothers. Such days [of varying fortunes] We give to men and men by turns: thatAllah may know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from yourranks Martyr-witnesses [to Truth]. And Allah loveth not those that do wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="143">141.  Allah's object also is to purge those that are true in Faith and to depriveof blessing Those that resist Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="144">142.  Did ye think that ye would enter Heaven without Allah testing those of youwho fought hard [In His Cause] and remained steadfast? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="145">143.  Ye did indeed wish for death before ye met him: Now ye have seen him withyour own eyes, [And ye flinch!] </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="146">144.  Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passedaway before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then Turn back on your heels?If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; butAllah [on the other hand] will swiftly reward those who [serve Him] withgratitude. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="147">145.  Nor can a soul die except by Allah's leave, the term being fixed as bywriting. If any do desire a reward in this life, We shall give it to him; and ifany do desire a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give it to him. And swiftlyshall We reward those that [serve us with] gratitude. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="148">146.  How many of the prophets fought [in Allah's way], and with them [fought]Large bands of godly men? but they never lost heart if they met with disaster inAllah's way, nor did they weaken [in will] nor give in. And Allah Loves thosewho are firm and steadfast. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="149">147.  All that they said was: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and anything We mayhave done that transgressed our duty: Establish our feet firmly, and help usagainst those that resist Faith." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="150">148.  And Allah gave them a reward in this world, and the excellent reward of theHereafter. For Allah Loveth those who do good. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="151">149.  O ye who believe! If ye obey the Unbelievers, they will drive you back onyour heels, and ye will turn back [from Faith] to your own loss. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="152">150.  Nay, Allah is your protector, and He is the best of helpers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="153">151.  Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that theyjoined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority: their abodewill be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="154">152.  Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Wereabout to annihilate your enemy,-until ye flinched and fell to disputing aboutthe order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight [of the booty] whichye covet. Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="155">the Hereafter. Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but Heforgave you: For Allah is full of grace to those who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="156">153.  Behold! ye were climbing up the high ground, without even casting a sideglance at any one, and the Messenger in your rear was calling you back. Theredid Allah give you one distress after another by way of requital, to teach younot to grieve for [the booty] that had escaped you and for [the ill] that hadbefallen you. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="157">154.  After [the excitement] of the distress, He sent down calm on a band of youovercome with slumber, while another band was stirred to anxiety by their ownfeelings, Moved by wrong suspicions of Allah-suspicions due to ignorance. Theysaid: "What affair is this of ours?" Say thou: "Indeed, this affair is whollyAllah's." They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say[to themselves]: "If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should nothave been in the slaughter here." Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes,those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place oftheir death"; but [all this was] that Allah might test what is in your breastsand purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of yourhearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="158">155.  Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts Met,-it was Satan whocaused them to fail, because of some [evil] they had done. But Allah Has blottedout [their fault]: For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="159">156.  O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers, who say of their brethren,when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: "If they hadstayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain." This that Allah maymake it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that givesLife and Death, and Allah sees well all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="160">157.  And if ye are slain, or die, in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercyfrom Allah are far better than all they could amass. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="161">158.  And if ye die, or are slain, Lo! it is unto Allah that ye are broughttogether. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="162">159.  It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them Wertthou severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: sopass over [Their faults], and ask for [Allah's] forgiveness for them; andconsult them in affairs [of moment]. Then, when thou hast Taken a decision putthy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust [in Him]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="163">160.  If Allah helps you, none can overcome you: If He forsakes you, who isthere, after that, that can help you? in Allah, then, Let believers put theirtrust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="164">161.  No prophet could [ever] be false to his trust. If any person is so false,He shall, on the Day of Judgment, restore what he misappropriated; then shallevery soul receive its due,- whatever it earned,- and none shall be dealt withunjustly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="165">162.  Is the man who follows the good pleasure of Allah Like the man who draws onhimself the wrath of Allah, and whose abode is in Hell?- A woeful refuge! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="166">163.  They are in varying gardens in the sight of Allah, and Allah sees well allthat they do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="167">164.  Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them amessenger from among themselves, rehearsing unto them the Signs of Allah,sanctifying them, and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom, while, beforethat, they had been in manifest error. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="168">165.  What! When a single disaster smites you, although ye smote [your enemies]with one twice as great, do ye say?- "Whence is this?" Say [to them]: "It isfrom yourselves: For Allah hath power over all things." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="169">166.  What ye suffered on the day the two armies Met, was with the leave ofAllah, in order that He might test the believers,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="170">167.  And the Hypocrites also. These were told: "Come, fight in the way of Allah,or [at least] drive [The foe from your city]." They said: "Had we known how tofight, we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer toUnbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts butAllah hath full knowledge of all they conceal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="171">168.  [They are] the ones that say, [of their brethren slain], while theythemselves sit [at ease]: "If only they had listened to us they would not havebeen slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="172">169.  Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live,finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="173">170.  They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah: And with regard to those leftbehind, who have not yet joined them [in their bliss], the [Martyrs] glory inthe fact that on them is no fear, nor have they [cause to] grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="174">171.  They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah, and in the fact thatAllah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost [in the least]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="175">172.  Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger, even after beingwounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="176">173.  Men said to them: "A great army is gathering against you": And frightenedthem: But it [only] increased their Faith: They said: "For us Allah sufficeth,and He is the best disposer of affairs." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="177">174.  And they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah: no harm ever touchedthem: For they followed the good pleasure of Allah: And Allah is the Lord ofbounties unbounded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="178">175.  It is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Beye not afraid of them, but fear Me, if ye have Faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="179">176.  Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the leastharm will they do to Allah: Allah's plan is that He will give them no portion inthe Hereafter, but a severe punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="180">177.  Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith,- not the least harm willthey do to Allah, but they will have a grievous punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="181">178.  Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good forthemselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But theywill have a shameful punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="182">179.  Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now, untilHe separates what is evil from what is good nor will He disclose to you thesecrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers [For the purpose] whomHe pleases. So believe in Allah. And His messengers: And if ye believe and doright, ye have a reward without measure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="183">180.  And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hathgiven them of His Grace, think that it is good for them: Nay, it will be theworse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied totheir necks Like a twisted collar, on the Day of Judgment. To Allah belongs theheritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with allthat ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="184">181.  Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: "Truly, Allah is indigent andwe are rich!"- We shall certainly record their word and [their act] of slayingthe prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: "Taste ye the penalty ofthe Scorching Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="185">182.  "This is because of the [unrighteous deeds] which your hands sent on beforeye: For Allah never harms those who serve Him." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="186">183.  They [also] said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in an messengerunless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire [From heaven]." Say: "Therecame to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye askfor: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="187">184.  Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who camewith Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="188">185.  Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgmentshall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fireand admitted to the Garden will have attained the object [of Life]: For the lifeof this world is but goods and chattels of deception. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="189">186.  Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in yourpersonal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you, fromthose who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. Butif ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be adetermining factor in all affairs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="190">187.  And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book, to make itknown and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behindtheir backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargainthey made! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="191">188.  Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about, and love tobe praised for what they have not done,- think escape the penalty. For them is apenalty Grievous indeed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="192">189.  To Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth; and Allahhath power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="193">190.  Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternationof night and day,- there are indeed Signs for men of understanding,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="194">191.  Men who celebrate the praises of Allah, standing, sitting, and lying downon their sides, and contemplate the [wonders of] creation in the heavens and theearth, [With the thought]: "Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created [all]this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="195">192.  "Our Lord! any whom Thou dost admit to the Fire, Truly Thou coverest withshame, and never will wrong-doers Find any helpers! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="196">193.  "Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling [Us] to Faith, 'Believe yein the Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, blot out fromus our iniquities, and take to Thyself our souls in the company of therighteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="197">194.  "Our Lord! Grant us what Thou didst promise unto us through Thinemessengers, and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment: For Thou neverbreakest Thy promise." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="198">195.  And their Lord hath accepted of them, and answered them: "Never will Isuffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: Ye are members,one of another: Those who have left their homes, or been driven out therefrom,or suffered harm in My Cause, or fought or been slain,- verily, I will blot out </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="199">from them their iniquities, and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowingbeneath;- A reward from the presence of Allah, and from His presence is the bestof rewards." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="200">196.  Let not the strutting about of the Unbelievers through the land deceivethee: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="201">197.  Little is it for enjoyment: Their ultimate abode is Hell: what an evil bed[To lie on]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="202">198.  On the other hand, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens, with riversflowing beneath; therein are they to dwell [for ever],- a gift from the presenceof Allah; and that which is in the presence of Allah is the best [bliss] for therighteous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="203">199.  And there are, certainly, among the People of the Book, those who believein Allah, in the revelation to you, and in the revelation to them, bowing inhumility to Allah: They will not sell the Signs of Allah for a miserable gain!For them is a reward with their Lord, and Allah is swift in account. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="204">200.  O ye who believe! Persevere in patience and constancy; vie in suchperseverance; strengthen each other; and fear Allah; that ye may prosper. </p>
