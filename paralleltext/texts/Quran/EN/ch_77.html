<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  By the [Winds] sent forth one after another [to man's profit]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Which then blow violently in tempestuous Gusts, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And scatter [things] far and wide; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Then separate them, one from another, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Then spread abroad a Message, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Whether of Justification or of Warning;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Assuredly, what ye are promised must come to pass. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Then when the stars become dim; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  When the heaven is cleft asunder; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  When the mountains are scattered [to the winds] as dust; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  And when the messengers are [all] appointed a time [to collect];-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  For what Day are these [portents] deferred? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  For the Day of Sorting out. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And what will explain to thee what is the Day of Sorting out? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Did We not destroy the men of old [for their evil]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  So shall We make later [generations] follow them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Thus do We deal with men of sin. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Have We not created you from a fluid [held] despicable?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  The which We placed in a place of rest, firmly fixed, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  For a period [of gestation], determined [according to need]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  For We do determine [according to need]; for We are the best to determine[things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Ah woe, that Day! to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Have We not made the earth [as a place] to draw together. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  The living and the dead, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And made therein mountains standing firm, lofty [in stature]; and providedfor you water sweet [and wholesome]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  [It will be said:] "Depart ye to that which ye used to reject as false! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  "Depart ye to a Shadow [of smoke ascending] in three columns, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  "[Which yields] no shade of coolness, and is of no use against the fierceBlaze. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  "Indeed it throws about sparks [huge] as Forts, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  "As if there were [a string of] yellow camels [marching swiftly]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  That will be a Day when they shall not be able to speak. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Nor will it be open to them to put forth pleas. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  That will be a Day of Sorting out! We shall gather you together and thosebefore [you]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  Now, if ye have a trick [or plot], use it against Me! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  As to the Righteous, they shall be amidst [cool] shades and springs [ofwater]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  And [they shall have] fruits,- all they desire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  "Eat ye and drink ye to your heart's content: for that ye worked[Righteousness]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  Thus do We certainly reward the Doers of Good. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  [O ye unjust!] Eat ye and enjoy yourselves [but] a little while, for that yeare Sinners. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  And when it is said to them, "Prostrate yourselves!" they do not so. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  Then what Message, after that, will they believe in? </p>
