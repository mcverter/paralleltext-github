<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 59. Hashr, or The Gathering (or Banishment) </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, let it declare the Praises and Gloryof Allah: for He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from theirhomes at the first gathering [of the forces]. Little did ye think that theywould get out: And they thought that their fortresses would defend them fromAllah! But the [Wrath of] Allah came to them from quarters from which theylittle expected [it], and cast terror into their hearts, so that they destroyedtheir dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers, take warning,then, O ye with eyes [to see]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And had it not been that Allah had decreed banishment for them, He wouldcertainly have punished them in this world: And in the Hereafter they shall[certainly] have the Punishment of the Fire. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  That is because they resisted Allah and His Messenger: and if any one resistsAllah, verily Allah is severe in Punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Whether ye cut down [O ye Muslim!] The tender palm-trees, or ye left themstanding on their roots, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He mightcover with shame the rebellious transgresses. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger [and taken away] from them - forthis ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: but Allah gives powerto His messengers over any He pleases: and Allah has power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  What Allah has bestowed on His Messenger [and taken away] from the people ofthe townships,- belongs to Allah,- to His Messenger and to kindred and orphans,the needy and the wayfarer; In order that it may not [merely] make a circuitbetween the wealthy among you. So take what the Messenger assigns to you, anddeny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And fear Allah; for Allah isstrict in Punishment. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  [Some part is due] to the indigent Muhajirs, those who were expelled fromtheir homes and their property, while seeking Grace from Allah and [His] GoodPleasure, and aiding Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the sincere ones:-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  But those who before them, had homes [in Medina] and had adopted the Faith,-show their affection to such as came to them for refuge, and entertain no desirein their hearts for things given to the [latter], but give them preference overthemselves, even though poverty was their [own lot]. And those saved from thecovetousness of their own souls,- they are the ones that achieve prosperity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And those who came after them say: "Our Lord! Forgive us, and our brethrenwho came before us into the Faith, and leave not, in our hearts, rancour [orsense of injury] against those who have believed. Our Lord! Thou art indeed Fullof Kindness, Most Merciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Hast thou not observed the Hypocrites say to their misbelieving brethrenamong the People of the Book? - "If ye are expelled, we too will go out withyou, and we will never hearken to any one in your affair; and if ye are attacked[in fight] we will help you". But Allah is witness that they are indeed liars. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  If they are expelled, never will they go out with them; and if they areattacked [in fight], they will never help them; and if they do help them, theywill turn their backs; so they will receive no help. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Of a truth ye are stronger [than they] because of the terror in theirhearts, [sent] by Allah. This is because they are men devoid of understanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  They will not fight you [even] together, except in fortified townships, orfrom behind walls. Strong is their fighting [spirit] amongst themselves: thouwouldst think they were united, but their hearts are divided: that is becausethey are a people devoid of wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Like those who lately preceded them, they have tasted the evil result oftheir conduct; and [in the Hereafter there is] for them a grievous Penalty;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  [Their allies deceived them], like the Evil One, when he says to man, "DenyAllah": but when [man] denies Allah, [the Evil One] says, "I am free of thee: Ido fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  The end of both will be that they will go into the Fire, dwelling thereinfor ever. Such is the reward of the wrong-doers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and let every soul look to what [provision] Hehas sent forth for the morrow. Yea, fear Allah: for Allah is well-acquaintedwith [all] that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And be ye not like those who forgot Allah; and He made them forget their ownsouls! Such are the rebellious transgressors! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  Not equal are the Companions of the Fire and the Companions of the Garden:it is the Companions of the Garden, that will achieve Felicity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, verily, thou wouldst have seenit humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of Allah. Such are the similitudes which We propound to men, that they may reflect. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- Who knows [all things] bothsecret and open; He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- the Sovereign, the Holy One,the Source of Peace [and Perfection], the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver ofSafety, the Exalted in Might, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory to Allah![High is He] above the partners they attribute to Him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  He is Allah, the Creator, the Evolver, the Bestower of Forms [or Colours].To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth,doth declare His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. </p>
