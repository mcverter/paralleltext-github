<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 89. Fajr, or The Break of Day </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  By the break of Day </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  By the Nights twice five; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  By the even and odd [contrasted]; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And by the Night when it passeth away;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Is there [not] in these an adjuration [or evidence] for those who understand? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the 'Ad [people],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Of the [city of] Iram, with lofty pillars, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  The like of which were not produced in [all] the land? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  And with the Thamud [people], who cut out [huge] rocks in the valley?-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  And with Pharaoh, lord of stakes? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  [All] these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And heaped therein mischief [on mischief]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Therefore did thy Lord pour on them a scourge of diverse chastisements: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  For thy Lord is [as a Guardian] on a watch-tower. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Now, as for man, when his Lord trieth him, giving him honour and gifts, thensaith he, [puffed up], "My Lord hath honoured me." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  But when He trieth him, restricting his subsistence for him, then saith he[in despair], "My Lord hath humiliated me!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  Nay, nay! but ye honour not the orphans! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Nor do ye encourage one another to feed the poor!-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And ye devour inheritance - all with greed, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And ye love wealth with inordinate love! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Nay! When the earth is pounded to powder, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  And thy Lord cometh, and His angels, rank upon rank, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  And Hell, that Day, is brought [face to face],- on that Day will manremember, but how will that remembrance profit him? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  He will say: "Ah! Would that I had sent forth [good deeds] for [this] my[Future] Life!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  For, that Day, His Chastisement will be such as none [else] can inflict, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And His bonds will be such as none [other] can bind. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  [To the righteous soul will be said:] "O [thou] soul, in [complete] rest andsatisfaction! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  "Come back thou to thy Lord,- well pleased [thyself], and well-pleasing untoHim! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "Enter thou, then, among My devotees! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  "Yea, enter thou My Heaven! </p>
