<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 27. Naml, or the Ants </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  These are verses of the Qur'an,-a book that makes [things] clear; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  A guide: and glad tidings for the believers,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Those who establish regular prayers and give in regular charity, and alsohave [full] assurance of the hereafter. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  As to those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their deedspleasing in their eyes; and so they wander about in distraction. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Such are they for whom a grievous Penalty is [waiting]; and in the Hereaftertheirs will be the greatest loss. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  As to thee, the Qur'an is bestowed upon thee from the presence of one who iswise and all-knowing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  Behold! Moses said to his family: "I perceive a fire; soon will I bring youfrom there some information, or I will bring you a burning brand to light ourfuel, that ye may warn yourselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  But when he came to the [fire], a voice was heard: "Blessed are those in thefire and those around: and glory to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  "O Moses! verily, I am Allah, the exalted in might, the wise!... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  "Now do thou throw thy rod!" But when he saw it moving [of its own accord]asif it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps:"O Moses!" [it was said], "Fear not: truly, in My presence, those called asmessengers have no fear,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  "But if any have done wrong and have thereafter substituted good to take theplace of evil, truly, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  "Now put thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain[or harm]: [these are] among the nine Signs [thou wilt take] to Pharaoh and hispeople: for they are a people rebellious in transgression." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  But when Our Signs came to them, that should have opened their eyes, theysaid: "This is sorcery manifest!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  And they rejected those Signs in iniquity and arrogance, though their soulswere convinced thereof: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  We gave [in the past] knowledge to David and Solomon: And they both said:"Praise be to Allah, Who has favoured us above many of his servants whobelieve!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  And Solomon was David's heir. He said: "O ye people! We have been taught thespeech of birds, and on us has been bestowed [a little] of all things: this isindeed Grace manifest [from Allah.]" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts,- of Jinns and men and birds,and they were all kept in order and ranks. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  At length, when they came to a [lowly] valley of ants, one of the ants said:"O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you[under foot] without knowing it." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: "O my Lord! so order methat I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on myparents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admitme, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: "Why is it I see not theHoopoe? Or is he among the absentees? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  "I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty, or execute him, unlesshe bring me a clear reason [for absence]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he [came up and] said: "I have compassed[territory] which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Sabawith tidings true. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  "I found [there] a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite;and she has a magnificent throne. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  "I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides Allah: Satan hasmade their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes, and has kept them away from thePath,- so they receive no guidance,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  "[Kept them away from the Path], that they should not worship Allah, Whobrings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what yehide and what ye reveal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  "Allah!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  [Solomon] said: "Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  "Go thou, with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them: then draw backfrom them, and [wait to] see what answer they return"... </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  [The queen] said: "Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy ofrespect. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  "It is from Solomon, and is [as follows]: 'In the name of Allah, MostGracious, Most Merciful: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  "'Be ye not arrogant against me, but come to me in submission [to the trueReligion].'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  She said: "Ye chiefs! advise me in [this] my affair: no affair have Idecided except in your presence." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  They said: "We are endued with strength, and given to vehement war: but thecommand is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  She said: "Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make thenoblest of its people its meanest thus do they behave. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  "But I am going to send him a present, and [wait] to see with what [answer]return [my] ambassadors." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  Now when [the embassy] came to Solomon, he said: "Will ye give me abundancein wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which He hasgiven you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  "Go back to them, and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as theywill never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace, and theywill feel humbled [indeed]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  He said [to his own men]: "Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her thronebefore they come to me in submission?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  Said an 'Ifrit, of the Jinns: "I will bring it to thee before thou rise fromthy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose, and may be trusted." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  Said one who had knowledge of the Book: "I will bring it to thee within thetwinkling of an eye!" Then when [Solomon] saw it placed firmly before him, hesaid: "This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful orungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is [a gain] for his ownsoul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme inHonour!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  He said: "Transform her throne out of all recognition by her: let us seewhether she is guided [to the truth] or is one of those who receive noguidance." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  So when she arrived, she was asked, "Is this thy throne?" She said, "It wasjust like this; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this, and we havesubmitted to Allah [in Islam]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  And he diverted her from the worship of others besides Allah: for she was[sprung] of a people that had no faith. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it, she thought itwas a lake of water, and she [tucked up her skirts], uncovering her legs. Hesaid: "This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass." She said: "O myLord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do [now] submit [in Islam], with Solomon,to the Lord of the Worlds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  We sent [aforetime], to the Thamud, their brother Salih, saying, "ServeAllah": But behold, they became two factions quarrelling with each other. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  He said: "O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to thegood? If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive mercy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  They said: "Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee". Hesaid: "Your ill omen is with Allah; yea, ye are a people under trial." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  There were in the city nine men of a family, who made mischief in the land,and would not reform. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  They said: "Swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall make a secret nightattack on him and his people, and that we shall then say to his heir [when heseeks vengeance]: 'We were not present at the slaughter of his people, and weare positively telling the truth.'" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  They plotted and planned, but We too planned, even while they perceived itnot. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  Then see what was the end of their plot!- this, that We destroyed them andtheir people, all [of them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  Now such were their houses, - in utter ruin, - because they practised wrong­doing. Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  And We saved those who believed and practised righteousness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  [We also sent] Lut [as a messenger]: behold, He said to his people, "Do yedo what is shameful though ye see [its iniquity]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are apeople [grossly] ignorant! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  But his people gave no other answer but this: they said, "Drive out thefollowers of Lut from your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean andpure!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  But We saved him and his family, except his wife; her We destined to be ofthose who lagged behind. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  And We rained down on them a shower [of brimstone]: and evil was the showeron those who were admonished [but heeded not]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  Say: Praise be to Allah, and Peace on his servants whom He has chosen [forhis Message]. [Who] is better?- Allah or the false gods they associate [withHim]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  Or, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and Who sends you down rainfrom the sky? Yea, with it We cause to grow well-planted orchards full of beautyof delight: it is not in your power to cause the growth of the trees in them.[Can there be another] god besides Allah? Nay, they are a people who swerve fromjustice. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  Or, Who has made the earth firm to live in; made rivers in its midst; setthereon mountains immovable; and made a separating bar between the two bodies of </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">flowing water? [can there be another] god besides Allah? Nay, most of them knownot. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">62.  Or, Who listens to the [soul] distressed when it calls on Him, and Whorelieves its suffering, and makes you [mankind] inheritors of the earth? [Canthere be another] god besides Allah? Little it is that ye heed! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">63.  Or, Who guides you through the depths of darkness on land and sea, and Whosends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy? [Can therebe another] god besides Allah?- High is Allah above what they associate withHim! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">64.  Or, Who originates creation, then repeats it, and who gives you sustenancefrom heaven and earth? [Can there be another] god besides Allah? Say, "Bringforth your argument, if ye are telling the truth!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">65.  Say: None in the heavens or on earth, except Allah, knows what is hidden:nor can they perceive when they shall be raised up [for Judgment]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">66.  Still less can their knowledge comprehend the Hereafter: Nay, they are indoubt and uncertainty thereanent; nay, they are blind thereunto! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">67.  The Unbelievers say: "What! when we become dust,- we and our fathers,- shallwe really be raised [from the dead]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">68.  "It is true we were promised this,- we and our fathers before [us]: theseare nothing but tales of the ancients." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">69.  Say: "Go ye through the earth and see what has been the end of those guilty[of sin]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">70.  But grieve not over them, nor distress thyself because of their plots. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">71.  They also say: "When will this promise [come to pass]? [Say] if ye aretruthful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">72.  Say: "It may be that some of the events which ye wish to hasten on may be[close] in your pursuit!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">73.  But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind: Yet most of them areungrateful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">74.  And verily thy Lord knoweth all that their hearts do hide. As well as allthat they reveal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">75.  Nor is there aught of the unseen, in heaven or earth, but is [recorded] in aclear record. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">76.  Verily this Qur'an doth explain to the Children of Israel most of thematters in which they disagree. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">77.  And it certainly is a Guide and a Mercy to those who believe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">78.  Verily thy Lord will decide between them by His Decree: and He is Exalted inMight, All-Knowing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">79.  So put thy trust in Allah: for thou art on [the path of] manifest Truth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">80.  Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen, nor canst thou cause the deafto hear the call, [especially] when they turn back in retreat. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">81.  Nor canst thou be a guide to the blind, [to prevent them] from straying:only those wilt thou get to listen who believe in Our Signs, and they will bowin Islam. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">82.  And when the Word is fulfilled against them [the unjust], we shall producefrom the earth a beast to [face] them: He will speak to them, for that mankinddid not believe with assurance in Our Signs. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">83.  One day We shall gather together from every people a troop of those whoreject our Signs, and they shall be kept in ranks,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">84.  Until, when they come [before the Judgment-seat], [Allah] will say: "Did yereject My Signs, though ye comprehended them not in knowledge, or what was it yedid?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">85.  And the Word will be fulfilled against them, because of their wrong-doing,and they will be unable to speak [in plea]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">86.  See they not that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day togive them light? Verily in this are Signs for any people that believe! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">87.  And the Day that the Trumpet will be sounded - then will be smitten withterror those who are in the heavens, and those who are on earth, except such asAllah will please [to exempt]: and all shall come to His [Presence] as beingsconscious of their lowliness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">88.  Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall passaway as the clouds pass away: [such is] the artistry of Allah, who disposes ofall things in perfect order: for he is well acquainted with all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">89.  If any do good, good will [accrue] to them therefrom; and they will besecure from terror that Day. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">90.  And if any do evil, their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire: "Doye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">91.  For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city, Him Who hassanctified it and to Whom [belong] all things: and I am commanded to be of thosewho bow in Islam to Allah's Will,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">92.  And to rehearse the Qur'an: and if any accept guidance, they do it for thegood of their own souls, and if any stray, say: "I am only a Warner". </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">93.  And say: "Praise be to Allah, Who will soon show you His Signs, so that yeshall know them"; and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do. </p>
