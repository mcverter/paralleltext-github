<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 51. Zariyat, or the Winds that Scatter </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  By the [Winds] that scatter broadcast; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  And those that lift and bear away heavy weights; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  And those that flow with ease and gentleness; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  And those that distribute and apportion by Command;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Verily that which ye are promised is true; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And verily Judgment and Justice must indeed come to pass. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  By the Sky with [its] numerous Paths, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Truly ye are in a doctrine discordant, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Through which are deluded [away from the Truth] such as would be deluded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Woe to the falsehood-mongers,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  Those who [flounder] heedless in a flood of confusion: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  They ask, "When will be the Day of Judgment and Justice?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  [It will be] a Day when they will be tried [and tested] over the Fire! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  "Taste ye your trial! This is what ye used to ask to be hastened!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  As to the Righteous, they will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Taking joy in the things which their Lord gives them, because, before then,they lived a good life. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  They were in the habit of sleeping but little by night, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  And in the hour of early dawn, they [were found] praying for Forgiveness; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And in their wealth and possessions [was remembered] the right of the[needy,] him who asked, and him who [for some reason] was prevented [fromasking]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  On the earth are signs for those of assured Faith, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  As also in your own selves: Will ye not then see? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  And in heaven is your Sustenance, as [also] that which ye are promised. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  Then, by the Lord of heaven and earth, this is the very Truth, as much asthe fact that ye can speak intelligently to each other. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Has the story reached thee, of the honoured guests of Abraham? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Behold, they entered his presence, and said: "Peace!" He said, "Peace!" [andthought, "These seem] unusual people." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And placed it before them.. he said, "Will ye not eat?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  [When they did not eat], He conceived a fear of them. They said, "Fear not,"and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  But his wife came forward [laughing] aloud: she smote her forehead and said:"A barren old woman!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  They said, "Even so has thy Lord spoken: and He is full of Wisdom andKnowledge." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  [Abraham] said: "And what, O ye Messengers, is your errand [now]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  They said, "We have been sent to a people [deep] in sin;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  "To bring on, on them, [a shower of] stones of clay [brimstone], </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  "Marked as from thy Lord for those who trespass beyond bounds." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Then We evacuated those of the Believers who were there, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  But We found not there any just [Muslim] persons except in one house: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  And We left there a Sign for such as fear the Grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  And in Moses [was another Sign]: Behold, We sent him to Pharaoh, withauthority manifest. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  But [Pharaoh] turned back with his Chiefs, and said, "A sorcerer, or onepossessed!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  So We took him and his forces, and threw them into the sea; and his was theblame. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  And in the 'Ad [people] [was another Sign]: Behold, We sent against them thedevastating Wind: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  It left nothing whatever that it came up against, but reduced it to ruin androttenness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  And in the Thamud [was another Sign]: Behold, they were told, "Enjoy [yourbrief day] for a little while!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord: So the stunning noise[of an earthquake] seized them, even while they were looking on. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  Then they could not even stand [on their feet], nor could they helpthemselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  So were the People of Noah before them for they wickedly transgressed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who createthe vastness of pace. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  And We have spread out the [spacious] earth: How excellently We do spreadout! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  And of every thing We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  Hasten ye then [at once] to Allah: I am from Him a Warner to you, clear andopen! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  And make not another an object of worship with Allah: I am from Him a Warnerto you, clear and open! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  Similarly, no messenger came to the Peoples before them, but they said [ofhim] in like manner, "A sorcerer, or one possessed"! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  Is this the legacy they have transmitted, one to another? Nay, they arethemselves a people transgressing beyond bounds! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  So turn away from them: not thine is the blame. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  But teach [thy Message] for teaching benefits the Believers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  I have only created Jinns and men, that they may serve Me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  No Sustenance do I require of them, nor do I require that they should feedMe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  For Allah is He Who gives [all] Sustenance,- Lord of Power,- Steadfast [forever]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  For the Wrong-doers, their portion is like unto the portion of their fellows[of earlier generations]: then let them not ask Me to hasten [that portion]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  Woe, then, to the Unbelievers, on account of that Day of theirs which theyhave been promised! </p>
