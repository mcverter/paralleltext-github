<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  O Ye who believe! Put not yourselves forward before Allah and His Messenger;but fear Allah: for Allah is He Who hears and knows all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  O ye who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, norspeak aloud to him in talk, as ye may speak aloud to one another, lest yourdeeds become vain and ye perceive not. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Those that lower their voices in the presence of Allah's Messenger,- theirhearts has Allah tested for piety: for them is Forgiveness and a great Reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Those who shout out to thee from without the inner apartments - most of themlack understanding. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  If only they had patience until thou couldst come out to them, it would bebest for them: but Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  O ye who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with any news, ascertainthe truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and afterwards become full ofrepentance for what ye have done. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  And know that among you is Allah's Messenger: were he, in many matters, tofollow your [wishes], ye would certainly fall into misfortune: But Allah hasendeared the Faith to you, and has made it beautiful in your hearts, and He hasmade hateful to you Unbelief, wickedness, and rebellion: such indeed are thosewho walk in righteousness;-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  A Grace and Favour from Allah; and Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  If two parties among the Believers fall into a quarrel, make ye peace betweenthem: but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against the other, thenfight ye [all] against the one that transgresses until it complies with thecommand of Allah; but if it complies, then make peace between them with justice,and be fair: for Allah loves those who are fair [and just]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  The Believers are but a single Brotherhood: So make peace and reconciliationbetween your two [contending] brothers; and fear Allah, that ye may receiveMercy. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  O ye who believe! Let not some men among you laugh at others: It may be thatthe [latter] are better than the [former]: Nor let some women laugh at others:It may be that the [latter are better than the [former]: Nor defame nor besarcastic to each other, nor call each other by [offensive] nicknames: Ill-seeming is a name connoting wickedness, [to be used of one] after he hasbelieved: And those who do not desist are [indeed] doing wrong. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  O ye who believe! Avoid suspicion as much [as possible]: for suspicion insome cases is a sin: And spy not on each other behind their backs.

<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  O mankind! We created you from a single [pair] of a male and a female, andmade you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other [not that ye maydespise [each other]. Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is[he who is] the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is wellacquainted [with all things]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  The desert Arabs say, "We believe." Say, "Ye have no faith; but ye[only]say, 'We have submitted our wills to Allah,' For not yet has Faith enteredyour hearts. But if ye obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not belittle aughtof your deeds: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Only those are Believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, andhave never since doubted, but have striven with their belongings and theirpersons in the Cause of Allah: Such are the sincere ones. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Say: "What! Will ye instruct Allah about your religion? But Allah knows allthat is in the heavens and on earth: He has full knowledge of all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  They impress on thee as a favour that they have embraced Islam. Say, "Countnot your Islam as a favour upon me: Nay, Allah has conferred a favour upon youthat He has guided you to the faith, if ye be true and sincere. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  "Verily Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth: and Allah Seeswell all that ye do." </p>
