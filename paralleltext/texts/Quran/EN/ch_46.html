<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 46. Ahqaf, or Winding Sand tracts </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Ha-Mim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  The Revelation of the Book is from Allah the Exalted in Power, Full ofWisdom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  We created not the heavens and the earth and all between them but for justends, and for a Term Appointed: But those who reject Faith turn away from thatwhereof they are warned. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Say: "Do ye see what it is ye invoke besides Allah? Show me what it is theyhave created on earth, or have they a share in the heavens bring me a book[revealed] before this, or any remnant of knowledge [ye may have], if ye aretelling the truth! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  And who is more astray than one who invokes besides Allah, such as will notanswer him to the Day of Judgment, and who [in fact] are unconscious of theircall [to them]? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  And when mankind are gathered together [at the Resurrection], they will behostile to them and reject their worship [altogether]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say, of the Truthwhen it comes to them: "This is evident sorcery!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say: "Had I forged it, then can ye obtainno single [blessing] for me from Allah. He knows best of that whereof ye talk[so glibly]! Enough is He for a witness between me and you! And he is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  Say: "I am no bringer of new-fangled doctrine among the messengers, nor do Iknow what will be done with me or with you. I follow but that which is revealedto me by inspiration; I am but a Warner open and clear." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  Say: "See ye? If [this teaching] be from Allah, and ye reject it, and awitness from among the Children of Israel testifies to its similarity [withearlier scripture], and has believed while ye are arrogant, [how unjust ye are!]truly, Allah guides not a people unjust." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  The Unbelievers say of those who believe: "If [this Message] were a goodthing, [such men] would not have gone to it first, before us!" And seeing thatthey guide not themselves thereby, they will say, "this is an [old,] falsehood!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  And before this, was the Book of Moses as a guide and a mercy: And this Bookconfirms [it] in the Arabic tongue; to admonish the unjust, and as Glad Tidingsto those who do right. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Verily those who say, "Our Lord is Allah," and remain firm [on that Path],-on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Such shall be Companions of the Gardens, dwelling therein [for aye]: arecompense for their [good] deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: In pain did his mother bearhim, and in pain did she give him birth. The carrying of the [child] to hisweaning is [a period of] thirty months. At length, when he reaches the age offull strength and attains forty years, he says, "O my Lord! Grant me that I maybe grateful for Thy favour which Thou has bestowed upon me, and upon both myparents, and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve; and begracious to me in my issue. Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow [toThee] in Islam." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  Such are they from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and pass bytheir ill deeds: [They shall be] among the Companions of the Garden: a promise!of truth, which was made to them [in this life]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  But [there is one] who says to his parents, "Fie on you! Do ye hold out thepromise to me that I shall be raised up, even though generations have passedbefore me [without rising again]?" And they two seek Allah's aid, [and rebukethe son]: "Woe to thee! Have faith! for the promise of Allah is true." But hesays, "This is nothing but tales of the ancients!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Such are they against whom is proved the sentence among the previousgenerations of Jinns and men, that have passed away; for they will be [utterly]lost. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And to all are [assigned] degrees according to the deeds which they [havedone], and in order that [Allah] may recompense their deeds, and no injustice bedone to them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, [It willbe said to them]: "Ye received your good things in the life of the world, and yetook your pleasure out of them: but today shall ye be recompensed with a Penaltyof humiliation: for that ye were arrogant on earth without just cause, and thatye [ever] transgressed." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  Mention [Hud] one of 'Ad's [own] brethren: Behold, he warned his peopleabout the winding Sand-tracts: but there have been warners before him and afterhim: "Worship ye none other than Allah: Truly I fear for you the Penalty of aMighty Day." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  They said: "Hast thou come in order to turn us aside from our gods? Thenbring upon us the [calamity] with which thou dost threaten us, if thou arttelling the truth?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  He said: "The Knowledge [of when it will come] is only with Allah: Iproclaim to you the mission on which I have been sent: But I see that ye are apeople in ignorance!".. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  Then, when they saw the [Penalty in the shape of] a cloud traversing thesky, coming to meet their valleys, they said, "This cloud will give us rain!""Nay, it is the [Calamity] ye were asking to be hastened!- A wind wherein is aGrievous Penalty! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  "Everything will it destroy by the command of its Lord!" Then by the morningthey - nothing was to be seen but [the ruins of] their houses! thus do Werecompense those given to sin! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  And We had firmly established them in a [prosperity and] power which We havenot given to you [ye Quraish!] and We had endowed them with [faculties of]hearing, seeing, heart and intellect: but of no profit to them were their[faculties of] hearing, sight, and heart and intellect, when they went onrejecting the Signs of Allah; and they were [completely] encircled by that whichthey used to mock at! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  We destroyed aforetime populations round about you; and We have shown theSigns in various ways, that they may turn [to Us]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Why then was no help forthcoming to them from those whom they worshipped asgods, besides Allah, as a means of access [to Allah]? Nay, they left them in thelurch: but that was their falsehood and their invention. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  Behold, We turned towards thee a company of Jinns [quietly] listening to theQur'an: when they stood in the presence thereof, they said, "Listen in silence!"When the [reading] was finished, they returned to their people, to warn [them oftheir sins]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  They said, "O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses,confirming what came before it: it guides [men] to the Truth and to a StraightPath. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  "O our people, hearken to the one who invites [you] to Allah, and believe inhim: He will forgive you your faults, and deliver you from a Penalty Grievous. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  "If any does not hearken to the one who invites [us] to Allah, he cannotfrustrate [Allah's Plan] on earth, and no protectors can he have besides Allah:such men [wander] in manifest error." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and neverwearied with their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yea, verily Hehas power over all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, [theywill be asked,] "Is this not the Truth?" they will say, "Yea, by our Lord!" [Onewill say:] "Then taste ye the Penalty, for that ye were wont to deny [Truth]!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  Therefore patiently persevere, as did [all] messengers of inflexiblepurpose; and be in no haste about the [Unbelievers]. On the Day that they seethe [Punishment] promised them, [it will be] as if they had not tarried morethan an hour in a single day. [Thine but] to proclaim the Message: but shall anybe destroyed except those who transgress? </p>
