<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare the Praises and Gloryof Allah: to Him belongs dominion, and to Him belongs praise: and He has powerover all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  It is He Who has created you; and of you are some that are Unbelievers, andsome that are Believers: and Allah sees well all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  He has created the heavens and the earth in just proportions, and has givenyou shape, and made your shapes beautiful: and to Him is the final Goal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  He knows what is in the heavens and on earth; and He knows what ye concealand what ye reveal: yea, Allah knows well the [secrets] of [all] hearts. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Has not the story reached you, of those who rejected Faith aforetime? So theytasted the evil result of their conduct; and they had a grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  That was because there came to them messengers with Clear Signs, but theysaid: "Shall [mere] human beings direct us?" So they rejected [the Message] andturned away. But Allah can do without [them]: and Allah is free of all needs,worthy of all praise. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  The Unbelievers think that they will not be raised up [for Judgment]. Say:"Yea, By my Lord, Ye shall surely be raised up: then shall ye be told [thetruth] of all that ye did. And that is easy for Allah." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  Believe, therefore, in Allah and His Messenger, and in the Light which wehave sent down. And Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  The Day that He assembles you [all] for a Day of Assembly,- that will be aDay of mutual loss and gain [among you], and those who believe in Allah and workrighteousness,- He will remove from them their ills, and He will admit them toGardens beneath which Rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever: that will be theSupreme Achievement. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  But those who reject Faith and treat Our Signs as falsehoods, they will beCompanions of the Fire, to dwell therein for aye: and evil is that Goal. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  No kind of calamity can occur, except by the leave of Allah: and if any onebelieves in Allah, [Allah] guides his heart [aright]: for Allah knows allthings. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  So obey Allah, and obey His Messenger: but if ye turn back, the duty of OurMessenger is but to proclaim [the Message] clearly and openly. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  Allah! There is no god but He: and on Allah, therefore, let the Believersput their trust. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  O ye who believe! Truly, among your wives and your children are [some thatare] enemies to yourselves: so beware of them! But if ye forgive and overlook,and cover up [their faults], verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  Your riches and your children may be but a trial: but in the Presence ofAllah, is the highest, Reward. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  So fear Allah as much as ye can; listen and obey and spend in charity forthe benefit of your own soul and those saved from the covetousness of their ownsouls,- they are the ones that achieve prosperity. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  If ye loan to Allah, a beautiful loan, He will double it to your [credit],and He will grant you Forgiveness: for Allah is most Ready to appreciate[service], Most Forbearing,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  Knower of what is open, Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom. </p>
