<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">[SURA] 15. Al-Hijr, or The Rocky Tract </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">1.  A. L. R. These are the Ayats of Revelation,- of a Qur'an that makes thingsclear. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">2.  Again and again will those who disbelieve, wish that they had bowed [toAllah's will] in Islam. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">3.  Leave them alone, to enjoy [the good things of this life] and to pleasethemselves: let [false] hope amuse them: soon will knowledge [undeceive them]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">4.  Never did We destroy a population that had not a term decreed and assignedbeforehand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">5.  Neither can a people anticipate its term, nor delay it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">6.  They say: "O thou to whom the Message is being revealed! truly thou art mad[or possessed]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">7.  "Why bringest thou not angels to us if it be that thou hast the Truth?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">8.  We send not the angels down except for just cause: if they came [to theungodly], behold! no respite would they have! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">9.  We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it[from corruption]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">10.  We did send messengers before thee amongst the religious sects of old: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11.  But never came a messenger to them but they mocked him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">12.  Even so do we let it creep into the hearts of the sinners -</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">13.  That they should not believe in the [Message]; but the ways of the ancientshave passed away. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14.  Even if We opened out to them a gate from heaven, and they were to continue[all day] ascending therein, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">15.  They would only say: "Our eyes have been intoxicated: Nay, we have beenbewitched by sorcery." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">16.  It is We Who have set out the zodiacal signs in the heavens, and made themfair-seeming to [all] beholders; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">17.  And [moreover] We have guarded them from every cursed devil: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">18.  But any that gains a hearing by stealth, is pursued by a flaming fire,bright [to see]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">19.  And the earth We have spread out [like a carpet]; set thereon mountains firmand immovable; and produced therein all kinds of things in due balance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">20.  And We have provided therein means of subsistence,- for you and for thosefor whose sustenance ye are not responsible. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">21.  And there is not a thing but its [sources and] treasures [inexhaustible] arewith Us; but We only send down thereof in due and ascertainable measures. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">22.  And We send the fecundating winds, then cause the rain to descend from thesky, therewith providing you with water [in abundance], though ye are not theguardians of its stores. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">23.  And verily, it is We Who give life, and Who give death: it is We Who remaininheritors [after all else passes away]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">24.  To Us are known those of you who hasten forward, and those who lag behind. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">25.  Assuredly it is thy Lord Who will gather them together: for He is perfect inWisdom and Knowledge. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">26.  We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">27.  And the Jinn race, We had created before, from the fire of a scorching wind. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">28.  Behold! thy Lord said to the angels: "I am about to create man, fromsounding clay from mud moulded into shape; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">29.  "When I have fashioned him [in due proportion] and breathed into him of Myspirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">30.  So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">31.  Not so Iblis: he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32.  [Allah] said: "O Iblis! what is your reason for not being among those whoprostrated themselves?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">33.  [Iblis] said: "I am not one to prostrate myself to man, whom Thou didstcreate from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="35">34.  [Allah] said: "Then get thee out from here; for thou art rejected, accursed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="36">35.  "And the curse shall be on thee till the day of Judgment." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="37">36.  [Iblis] said: "O my Lord! give me then respite till the Day the [dead] areraised." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="38">37.  [Allah] said: "Respite is granted thee </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="39">38.  "Till the Day of the Time appointed." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="40">39.  [Iblis] said: "O my Lord! because Thou hast put me in the wrong, I will make[wrong] fair-seeming to them on the earth, and I will put them all in thewrong,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="41">40.  "Except Thy servants among them, sincere and purified [by Thy Grace]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="42">41.  [Allah] said: "This [way of My sincere servants] is indeed a way that leadsstraight to Me. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="43">42.  "For over My servants no authority shalt thou have, except such as putthemselves in the wrong and follow thee." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="44">43.  And verily, Hell is the promised abode for them all! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="45">44.  To it are seven gates: for each of those gates is a [special] class [ofsinners] assigned. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="46">45.  The righteous [will be] amid gardens and fountains [of clear-flowing water]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="47">46.  [Their greeting will be]: "Enter ye here in peace and security." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="48">47.  And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury: [theywill be] brothers [joyfully] facing each other on thrones [of dignity]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="49">48.  There no sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they [ever] be askedto leave. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="50">49.  Tell My servants that I am indeed the Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="51">50.  And that My Penalty will be indeed the most grievous Penalty. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="52">51.  Tell them about the guests of Abraham. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="53">52.  When they entered his presence and said, "Peace!" He said, "We feel afraidof you!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="54">53.  They said: "Fear not! We give thee glad tidings of a son endowed withwisdom." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="55">54.  He said: "Do ye give me glad tidings that old age has seized me? Of what,then, is your good news?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="56">55.  They said: "We give thee glad tidings in truth: be not then in despair!" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="57">56.  He said: "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, but such as go astray?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="58">57.  Abraham said: "What then is the business on which ye [have come], O yemessengers [of Allah]?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="59">58.  They said: "We have been sent to a people [deep] in sin, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="60">59.  "Excepting the adherents of Lut: them we are certainly [charged] to save[from harm],- All -</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="61">60.  "Except his wife, who, We have ascertained, will be among those who will lagbehind." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="62">61.  At length when the messengers arrived among the adherents of Lut, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="63">62.  He said: "Ye appear to be uncommon folk." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="64">63.  They said: "Yea, we have come to thee to accomplish that of which theydoubt. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="65">64.  "We have brought to thee that which is inevitably due, and assuredly we tellthe truth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="66">65.  "Then travel by night with thy household, when a portion of the night [yetremains], and do thou bring up the rear: let no one amongst you look back, butpass on whither ye are ordered." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="67">66.  And We made known this decree to him, that the last remnants of those[sinners] should be cut off by the morning. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="68">67.  The inhabitants of the city came in [mad] joy [at news of the young men]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="69">68.  Lut said: "These are my guests: disgrace me not: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="70">69.  "But fear Allah, and shame me not." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="71">70.  They said: "Did we not forbid thee [to speak] for all and sundry?" </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="72">71.  He said: "There are my daughters [to marry], if ye must act [so]." </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="73">72.  Verily, by thy life [O Prophet], in their wild intoxication, they wander indistraction, to and fro. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="74">73.  But the [mighty] Blast overtook them before morning, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="75">74.  And We turned [the cities] upside down, and rained down on them brimstoneshard as baked clay. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="76">75.  Behold! in this are Signs for those who by tokens do understand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="77">76.  And the [cities were] right on the high-road. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="78">77.  Behold! in this is a sign for those who believed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="79">78.  And the Companions of the Wood were also wrong-doers; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="80">79.  So We exacted retribution from them. They were both on an open highway,plain to see. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="81">80.  The Companions of the Rocky Tract also rejected the messengers: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="82">81.  We sent them Our Signs, but they persisted in turning away from them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="83">82.  Out of the mountains did they hew [their] edifices, [feeling themselves]secure. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="84">83.  But the [mighty] Blast seized them of a morning, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="85">84.  And of no avail to them was all that they did [with such art and care]! </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="86">85.  We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, but for justends. And the Hour is surely coming [when this will be manifest]. So overlook[any human faults] with gracious forgiveness. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="87">86.  For verily it is thy Lord who is the Master-Creator, knowing all things. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="88">87.  And We have bestowed upon thee the Seven Oft-repeated [verses] and the GrandQur'an. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="89">88.  Strain not thine eyes. [Wistfully] at what We have bestowed on certainclasses of them, nor grieve over them: but lower thy wing [in gentleness] to thebelievers. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="90">89.  And say: "I am indeed he that warneth openly and without ambiguity,"-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="91">90.  [Of just such wrath] as We sent down on those who divided [Scripture intoarbitrary parts],-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="92">91.  [So also on such] as have made Qur'an into shreds [as they please]. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="93">92.  Therefore, by the Lord, We will, of a surety, call them to account, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="94">93.  For all their deeds. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="95">94.  Therefore expound openly what thou art commanded, and turn away from thosewho join false gods with Allah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="96">95.  For sufficient are We unto thee against those who scoff,-</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="97">96.  Those who adopt, with Allah, another god: but soon will they come to know. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="98">97.  We do indeed know how thy heart is distressed at what they say. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="99">98.  But celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and be of those who prostratethemselves in adoration. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="100">99.  And serve thy Lord until there come unto thee the Hour that is Certain. </p>
